h2: Activities
learning-goal: Solidify understanding of what an algorithm is and why they're important
learning-goal: Practice implementing algorithms for search - linear & binary.
learning-goal: Improve algorithm performance using memoization.
learning-goal: Hide algorithmic details behind a layer of abstraction, allowing changes in the future.
learning-goal: Use the <span class="snap">snap</span>  timer to gather run time information
learning-goal: Observe the difference between constant, linear, quadratic and logarithmic run times.
