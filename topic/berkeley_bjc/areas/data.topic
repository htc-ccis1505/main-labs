h2: Big Ideas

big-idea: Learn how to pre-process data for analysing it with the computer
big-idea: Learn how clustering can help infer knowledge from data and answer questions
big-idea: Learn how a computer can supplement your own thinking for drawing conclusions from data
big-idea: Experience how patterns can emerge from computational processing of data

h2: Activities:
learning-goal: Process data, normalize the values, and visualize them
