# Running Your Own Server

While GitHub pages are convenient, you'll likely want to run your own web server to make debugging changes much more quick and easy. In order to view the labs, you'll need to have an Apache server running on your machine. The easiest way to setup a server is to use a simple, built-in Python server. 

1. cd into one level above the main-labs directory.
2. In a separate window run python -m SimpleHTTPServer (for Python 2) or python3 -m http.server for Python 3.
3. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/main-labs in a browser.
