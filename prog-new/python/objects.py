#
# Write a class to define a circle.
# The circle has a single property called radius.
# The circle has one behavior to calculate the area.
#   - The area is calculated as follows:
#        area = 3.14 * radius * radius

#
# Use your circle class to make a circle with a radius of 4.
# Print the radius of the circle.
# Print the area of the circle.

# Exercise 3
#
# Make a cylinder class that inherits from your cirle.
# It should add a new property called height.
# The cylinder has updated behavior to calculate the area.
#   - The area is calculated as follows:
#        area = (2 * 3.14 * radius * height) + (3.14 * radius * radius)
