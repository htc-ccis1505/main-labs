        <h2>Functions Homework Lab</h2>
        <p>
            For this next lab, you will once again just fill in some code below the comments in the <a href="/main-labs/prog-new/python/more_functions.py">more_functions.py</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure to set your name in the <code>your_name</code> variable at the top. (Surely you are not a silly student.)
        </p>
        <p>
          As you work through the lab, you will add code for each exercise after the comments.  Make sure
          test your functions with different input values so that you are sure they always behave correctly.
        </p>
