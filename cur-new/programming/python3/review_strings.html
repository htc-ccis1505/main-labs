        <h2>Review Strings</h2>
        <p>
            Recall that a string is just a sequence of characters, like a word or a sentence. To create a string, we set a variable to text enclosed in quotes (single or double) as shown below:
            <br><br>
            <pre><code>
>>> phrase = "Programming is awesome!"
>>> cat = 'Bart'
            </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
          Remember when you see the >>> in the examples, that indicates the example is entered into the python interactive shell.  Do NOT type the >>> into your python file.
        </p>
        <h3>String Length</h3>
        <p>
            We can get the length of a string by using the <code>len()</code> function.  This function returns (or reports in <span class="snap">snap</span> speak) back a value. To do something with that value, you can use it to set a variable.
            <br><br>
            <pre><code>
>>> len(phrase)
23
            </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>len()</code> function returns (or reports in <span class="snap">snap</span> speak) back a value. To do something with that value, use it to set a variable. Then you can use that variable in other statments such as a <code>print</code> or a loop.
          <br><br>
          <pre><code>
>>> phrase_length = len(phrase)
>>> print( "The length of the phrase is " + str(phrase_length) )
The length of the phrase is 23
          </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that in the code above the <code>+</code> operator was used to join strings together.
        </p>

        <h3>Characters and Substrings</h3>
        <p>
          We can access certain letters of a string by using square braces [].
          <br><br>
          <pre><code>
>>> first_letter = phrase[0]
>>> print( "The first letter of the phrase is " + first_letter )
The first letter of the phrase is P
          </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
          <strong>Common Mistake:</strong>
          <br>Remember that in python the first letter of a string is at position 0, not position 1.
          <br>
          Note:  Having the first element at the 0th position is called <b>"0 indexing"</b> and is very common in many  programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can get at parts of a string (or a substring) by using square braces with a colon. Substring <code>[start:end]</code> returns the letters in the word from <code>start</code> up to, but not including the character at <code>end</code>.
          <br><br>
          <pre><code>
>>> part = phrase[3:7]
>>> print( part )
gram
          </code></pre>
        </p>
