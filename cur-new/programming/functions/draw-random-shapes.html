      <h1>Draw Random Shapes</h1>
      <p>
        Let's have a little bit of fun...
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the blocks created earlier to write a script that will draw a random shapes of various sizes all over.
      </p>
  		<h2>Requirements</h2>
  		<p>
  			This is a pretty open ended assignment, so have fun with it.
  		</p>
  		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
  			<strong>The minimum requirements for this script are that it:</strong>
  			<br> - starts when the green flag button is clicked
  			<br> - uses the draw polygon block to draw random shapes of random sizes
  			<br> - uses a repeat to draw multiple shapes
  			<br> - uses randomness to draw a shapes in different positions filling the screen
  		</p>
      <p>Once you have that minimum requirements working, try to enhance the program by drawing in different colors. You might also experiment with rotating and/or combining the shapes. Remember those fancy screen-saver programs?  Be creative, the sky is the limit.</p>
