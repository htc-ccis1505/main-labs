  <title>Compose a "draw a flower" block</title>

<body>
  <p>
    Write a block that draws a full flower in the middle of the stage.

    Write simple custom blocks, or borrow from blocks you have already written, and then use those blocks inside your <code>draw a flower</code> block.  If you can, write blocks of intermediate complexity that use and are used by other blocks you write.
    <br><br>
    You might write:
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>draw flower head with ...</code>
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>draw stem with length []</code>
    <br><br>
    but don't feel constrained by this list. Use several inputs that control aspects of what the flower should look like.

    After you've worked on this for a bit, take a moment to look at what other students have done and chat.  If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design into your program.
