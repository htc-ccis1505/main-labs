      <h1>Field of Flowers</h1>
      <p>
        Time to go a little bit crazy...
      </p>
      <p>
        We are going to use the blocks we created earlier to write a script that will draw a field of random flowers.
      </p>
  		<h2>Requirements</h2>
  		<p>
  			This is a pretty open ended assignment, so have fun with it.
  		</p>
  		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
  			<strong>The minimum requirements for this script are that it:</strong>
  			<br> - starts when the green flag button is clicked
  			<br> - adds at least two new custom blocks that use the simpler blocks created earlier
  			<br> - uses repeat to draw multiple flowers filling the screen
  			<br> - incorporates randomness to draw a different field of flowers each time the script is run
  		</p>
      <h2>Starter File</h2>
      <p>
        This <a target="_blank" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:http://htc-ccis1505.github.io/main-labs/prog-new/snap/draw-field-of-flowers-with-backgrounds.xml"> starter project</a>, contains a few fun backgrounds. To use them, click on the <code>Stage</code> sprite at the lower right of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window, select the <code>Costumes</code> tab at the top of the scripting area, and select the background that you want for your program.
      </p>

      <h2>Composition with Custom Blocks</h2>
      <p>
        Using one custom block inside another custom block is called <em>composition</em>. We are going to use the simple blocks we made earlier to make more complex blocks to draw different types of flowers.
      <p>
      <p>
        Use some of the simple custom blocks you've already written, to create at least two new custom blocks that make use of those simpler blocks to do complicated things.
      </p>
      <p>Here is a custom block (from someone who went crazy) to give you some ideas:</p>
        <img class="center" src="/main-labs/img/drawing/crazy-draw-flower-block.png" alt="crazy complicated draw flower block with tons of inputs">
      <br><br>
      <p>
        You do not need to make a block exactly like that, just make at least two different blocks to draw some different types of flowers.  You'll use these custom draw flower blocks below in the main program script.
      </p>

      <h2>Draw Lots of Flowers</h2>
      <p>
        Use <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat block"> to draw lots of flowers, flowers with lots of petals, and so forth.
        <br><br>
        Use <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random block"> as much as you can to make the flowers interesting and different.
      </p>

  		<h2>Export and Submit</h2>
  		<p>
  			When everything works as you expect, export your script (refer back to the first inclass lab if you need help) and upload that to the lab dropbox in D2L.
