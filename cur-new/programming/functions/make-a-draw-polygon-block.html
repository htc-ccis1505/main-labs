  <p>
      Now, you are going to make a block that takes two inputs.
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteGreen">
      Create a <code>draw polygon</code> block that takes as inputs:
      <br> - a number of sides
      <br> - the length of each side
  <br><img class="center" src="/main-labs/img/prog/polyblock.png" alt="draw polygon () sides of length ()">
  <br>In the block, call these inputs <code>sides</code> and <code>length</code>.
  </p>

  <p >
      You should remember from
      <a href="/main-labs/cur-new/programming/loops/repeat-n/draw-regular-polygons-with-repeat.html"> this
      lesson</a> how to draw a regular polygon. How many degrees did we turn altogether? How many times do we turn?  What was the generalized pattern identified from the examples?
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteOrange">
      Testing is an important part of computer programming.  Make sure to test out your new block with different values for length and number of sides.  Testing allows you to catch your own errors before someone else finds them.
