        Every good programmer goes through this at some point, and I think that you are ready.
        <br><br>
        You need to make a bug dance.
      </p>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>

  		<h2>Requirements</h2>
  		<p>
  			This is a pretty open ended assignment, so have fun with it. However, don't feel like you need to choreograph a ballet or a music video.
  		</p>
  		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
  			<strong>The minimum requirements for this script are that it:</strong>
  			<br> - starts when the green flag button is clicked
  			<br> - uses at least 3 new custom blocks that you created
  			<br> - each custom block must control an interesting sequence sprite movements
        <br> - the custom blocks should use input parameters to alter the movement sequence in some way
  			<br> - sound is optional but encouraged
  		</p>

      <h2>Load the starter project</h2>
      <p>
        Load this
        <a class="run" href="/main-labs/prog-new/snap/bug-dance-starter-with-sound.xml"><span class="snap">snap</span> project</a>.
        (Or, <a class="run" href="/main-labs/prog-new/snap/bug-dance-starter.xml">this</a>
        is the same thing without the big sound file).
      <p>
      <p>
        We've made some starter custom blocks for you, in the "Looks" palette.  Definitely <code>edit...</code> them to see what we've done. We've also included a few examples of how to put them together for a dance.  Try it out.
      </p>

      <h2>Improve the Script</h2>
      <p>
        Make at least 3 custom blocks to do complicated steps, or to repeat sets of steps in ways that you'll do over and over.  Add inputs to your custom blocks to change your steps in interesting ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've included several costumes in the project that you should use in new steps. Look at how we used the costumes in the custom blocks we already created. You could also import your own sounds if you would like.  Go to the <code>Sounds</code> tab above the scripting area and drag a sound from your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have fun with this!
      </p>

  		<h2>Share!</h2>
  		<p>
  			This is another program that you are welcome to share in the chatroom.  For this assignment, sharing your dancing bug is officially OK.  However, it's never OK to copy or submit someone else's work as your own. I expect everyone's bug dance to be different and unique.
  		</p>

  		<h2>Export and Submit</h2>
  		<p>
  			When everything works as you expect, export your script (refer back to the first inclass lab if you need help) and upload that to the lab dropbox in D2L.
  		</p>
