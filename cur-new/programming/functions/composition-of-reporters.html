      <p>
          Consider the <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/building-blocks/max-3-arg.png"> block definition below which uses the max block that we looked at earlier:
      </p>

			<p>
          Using similar methodology, your challenge is to make the following blocks work by composing several functions together (with maybe a little extra work):
      </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
          A three-input addition operator that accepts only numbers.
          <br><img class="center" alt="Three-argument addition operator" src="/main-labs/img/prog/3-arg-addition-block-BYOB.gif">
			</li>
      <li>
          A predicate block named "Are any equal?" that compares 3 numbers and returns true if any two are equal to each other (the example shown below would return true):
          <br> <img class="center" alt="Are any equal? predicate block" src="/main-labs/img/building-blocks/composition-are-any-equal.png">
      </li>
			<li>
          A reporter block named "sum of two smallest" that takes three numbers as inputs, and reports the sum of the two smallest (the example shown below would report 9):
          <br><img class="center" alt="sum of two smallest block" src="/main-labs/img/cond/sum-of-two-smallest.png">
			</li>
		</ol>
