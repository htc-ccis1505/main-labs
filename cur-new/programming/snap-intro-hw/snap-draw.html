		<h1>Snap Draw</h1>
		<p>
				We're going to build a simple drawing program.  We'll have the sprite be our pen and have it follow the mouse around the stage.  We'll use the up and down arrow keys to control when the pen is up or down and will use letter keys to change the pen color.
		</p>

		<h2>Block Intro</h2>
		<p>We will use the following blocks to build this program:</p>
		<img src="/main-labs/img/lab1-hw/snap-draw-all-blocks.png" alt="Image of blocks used" /><br/>

		<p>
			Most of these blocks were introduced in the in-class lab.  Try to figure out what the new blocks do by using them.
		</p>

		<h2>Step 1: Clear and Follow</h2>
		<p>
			Start by clearing the screen when the program starts (green flag). Then make the sprite follow the mouse.  We did that earlier in the in-class lab.  Try to remember how that worked and recreate it here.  If you get stuck you can always go back and look at the in-class lab.
		</p>

		<p>
			Test things out and make sure they work correctly before moving on.  When you start the program using the green flag button, the stage should be cleared and the sprite should follow the mouse as you move it around the stage.
		</p>

		<h2>Step 2: Pen up and down</h2>
		<p>
			Once you have the sprite following the mouse, we want to use the up and down arrow keys to control the pen, so that it is not always drawing a line.  Figure out how to pick up the pen when the up arrow key is pressed and put the pen down when the down arrow key is pressed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Test things out and make sure they work correctly before moving on.  When you start the program using the green flag button, the stage should be cleared and the sprite should follow the mouse as you move it around the stage.  If you press the down arrow, it should start to draw a line as you move around the stage. If you press the up arrow it should stop drawing.
		</p>

		<h2>Step 3: Add some color</h2>
		<p>
			You've already got the main program working!  Now it's just icing on the cake.  Add at least 4 different pen colors.  Use letters of the alphabet to trigger the color change. For example when the g key is pressed, switch to green.  When the r key is pressed, switch to red.  Pick your favorite colors and shades.
		</p>

		<h2>Extra: Pen Size</h2>
		<p>
			See if you can figure out how to change the pen size (so it draws with a thicker or thinner line) when the left and right arrow keys are pressed.

			Assignments will often have extras.  They aren't required, but will count as "bonus" points which are applied at the end of the semester as discussed in the syllabus.  If you do an extra, make sure to call it out in the notes when you submit the assignment so it isn't overlooked.
		</p>

		<h2>Export and Submit</h2>
		<p>
			When everything works as you expect, export your script (refer back to the inclass lab if you need help) and upload that to the lab dropbox in D2L.
