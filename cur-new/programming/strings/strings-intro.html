  In programming, words and sentences are often called <i>strings</i>. A <b>string</b> is just a sequence of characters. Those characters might be anything - letters, spaces, numbers, punctuation, etc.
</p>
<p>
  In this lab we will practice working with variables, loops, and conditions while learning to work with strings.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="snap">Snap</span> has many blocks that allow us to work with strings. You have seen some of these already, such as the <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/join.png" alt="join (hello) (world)"/> block which is used to join two values together. We can use this block to join to words or sentences (strings) with variables and the values that come from reporter blocks.
</p>

<p  class="alert quoteOrange">
  When you use the <code>join</code> block to put values together, you need to add spaces at the beginning and end of words or sentences to make them look nice.
</p>

<p>By using the <code>join</code> block, we can put together any number of values by clicking on the arrows on the right side of the block to add additional input slots.
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example where we have added an additional input slot to join two strings and a variable:
</p>
<p><img src="/main-labs/img/building-blocks/join-variable.png" alt="join with a variable"></p>
<p>
  Do you see the little dot after the word "Hello" in the example above?  That is a space character.  Since you cannot typically see a space character, it is shown in the input as a little dot so that you know it is there.
</p>
<p>
  It's important to use spaces in the <code>join</code> block when joining variables into sentences so that the messages and the variables are not squished together.  We want to see this code say "<b>Hello Alonzo</b>" with the space between words, not "<b>HelloAlonzo</b>" without a space.
