    Let's try a few more...
</p>

<p>Make a block to count the number of vowels in a word. (You can assume it is a single word, not a sentence with punctuation or spaces.)</p>
<p class="alert quoteOrange">
    Don't forget to use composition!  Use the block that you made earlier to check if a character is a vowel.
</p>

<p>Make a block to count the number of consonants in a word.</p>
<p class="alert quoteOrange">
    Again, think about composition!  How can you use the above block to make this task easier?
</p>

<p class="alert quoteGreen">
<b>Challenge:</b> Make a block to remove all spaces from just the beginning and end of a string. (Any spaces between words should be kept.)</p>
