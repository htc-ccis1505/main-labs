<p>
  The <span class="snap">Snap</span> blocks for working with Strings are found on the Operators palette. You can probably guess what they will do, just by looking at them.
</p>
<h3>Get a character</h3>
<p>The <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/letter-x-of-word.png" alt="letter (1) of (world)"/> block will give you back a single character from the string. In this case, the block would report <code>w</code> since that is <code>letter 1 of world</code>.
</p>

<h3>Length</h3>
<p>The <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/length-of-word.png" alt="length of (world)"/> block will tell you how many characters are in the string. In this case, the block would report <code>5</code> since that is the <code>length of world</code>.
</p>

<h3>Type</h3>
<p>The <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/is-a.png" alt="is (5) a (text)"/> block will tell you if a value is a number. However you can also use it to identify other types as well by using the dropdown menu next to number. One of the other options is text. So this block can also be used to tell you if something is text instead of a number.

<p class="alert quoteBlue">
  Experiment with the <code>is () a () ?</code> block to see what type of values it considers text and what it does not.
