<p>
    Let's try making some example blocks using strings and loops.
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
	  Make a command block to spell out a word one letter at a time. (To spell out the word, just have the sprite say each letter for 1 second.)
  </li>

  <li>
	  Make a block to determine if a letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u).  Instead of using a series of if statements, make a string "aeiou" and use a loop to check the input letter against each vowel.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="alert quoteOrange">
    Pick one (or both) of the above blocks. Try to rewrite the code with each of the different types of loops: for, repeat, and repeat until.

    <br>On an exam, you may be told to use a particular type of loop, so it is good to be able to write the same code multiple ways.
