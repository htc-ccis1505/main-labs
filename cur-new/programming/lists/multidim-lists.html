    <h2>Multi-Dimensional Lists</h2>

    <p>
      Throughout the course you will find many uses for lists.  We can have lists of words, such as those from the previous example. We can also have lists of numbers, perhaps to keep track of your grades in this course.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we can also used lists to store more complex data by using a list as an item inside another list.  We might use a list to represent a sprite's position as a single pair containing the X and Y position numbers, and then collect a list of those pairs to move the sprite or to draw a graph.

    <p>
      Here is an example where a list is used to hold a persons first and last name separately:<br>
      <img border="0" title="List of the list John and Lennon, the list Paul and McCartney, etc." alt="List of the list John and Lennon, the list Paul and McCartney, etc." src="/main-labs/img/list/hof/Beatles.png" />
    </p>

    <p class="alert quoteGreen">
      <b>Try this: </b>
      Use the <code>map</code> HOF and this list to get a list of just the first names of the Beatles.<br>
      <img border="0" title="John, Paul, George, Ringo" alt="John, Paul, George, Ringo" src="/main-labs/img/list/hof/jpgr.png"/>
    </p>
