   <title>Number-Guessing Game v2.0</title>

	<p>
	    We are going to assume that you are comfortable with how the code provided in the previous section works. Here's the script again:

	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>
		Update the starter code with <em>all</em> of the following six improvements. After adding an improvement, play and test the game to make sure it is correct before adding the next.
	</p>
	<ol>
    <li>
      The sprite should welcome the player and ask for their name before beginning.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the player guesses incorrectly, the sprite should tell them that the guess is incorrect, using their name. For example, if Colleen is playing the game, the sprite should say something like <code>Sorry Colleen, that is not the right answer.</code> before asking them to guess again.
    </li>
    <li>
       If player guesses incorrectly, the sprite should tell them if the secret number is bigger or smaller than the number that they guessed.
    </li>
    <li>
       Right now, the script always picks a number between <code>1</code> and <code>10</code>. Change this so that it picks a number between <code>1</code> and a variable named <code>maximum</code>. Ask the player what they would like the maximum number to be, before choosing a random number. Use this maximum number as the highest number that the script will choose.
    </li>
    <li>
       Keep track of how many guesses it takes before the player guesses the right number.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the player guesses the secret number, tell them how many guesses it took, and congratulate them using their name.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Extras</h3>
  <p>
    For the extras, you may find the <code>repeat until</code> block handy. It will repeat the code inside the block until the condition given is true.  When the condition is true, the loop will end.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Verify that the player is actually entering a number and not a word or letter. Note the <code>is () a [number]?</code> predicate block on the Operators palette. If they do not enter a number, tell them before asking them to guess again.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the player guesses correctly, ask if they would like to play again.  Continue repeating the game until the player says to quit.
    </li>
  <ul>
