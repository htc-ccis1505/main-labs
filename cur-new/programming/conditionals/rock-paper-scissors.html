			For this activity, you will create the <em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em> game described on the previous page.
		</p>

		<p>
			This script will use two different sprites. Each will do similar things when the green flag button is pressed to start the script. It may be easiest to get the script working for the first sprite, and then duplicate that code and drop it onto a second sprite.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteBlue">
			You may use any two costumes/sprites you like - it doesn't have to be the cat & dog.  There are a lot of sprite "Costumes" that you can import from the Snap! File menu. The cat shown is "Cat 4" and the dog is "Dog 2b".
		</p>

		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>The minimum requirements for this script are that it:</strong>
			<br> - starts when the green flag button is clicked
			<br> - sets a <em>hidden</em> variable for each sprite to a random number between 1 and 3 when the script starts
			<br> - uses that variable to determine which word the sprite should say
		</p>

		<h3>Extras</h3>

		<p class="alert quoteBlue">
			For a variable to be visible across many sprites, it is helpful to use a global variable instead of a script variable. However, you should <i>prefer</i> script variables when this behavior is not needed.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Add a third sprite. After the first two sprites pick their choice and say it, the third sprite should say who wins. You may find <a href="/main-labs/img/prog/RPS.pdf" target="new">this chart</a> useful.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add two additional variables that keep track of how many times each character has won. You can make these variables visible on the stage by clicking on the check-box next to the variable name.
			</li>
		</ul>
