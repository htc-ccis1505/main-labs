      Let's practice writing some blocks that utilize predicates like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.
   </p>

   <ul>
	   <li>
	       Write a <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/cond/weekend.png" alt="weekend (_)"/> block that reports
	       whether a given day is a weekend. Let's assume that only Saturday and Sunday are part of the weekend.
	   </li>
	   <li>
	       Write a <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/cond/weekday.png" alt="weekday (_)"/> block. You could write
	       this with or without your <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/cond/weekend.png" alt="weekend (_)"/>
	       block, but it'll be much easier if you do.
	   </li>
   </ul>
