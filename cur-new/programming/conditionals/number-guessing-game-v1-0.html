      <p>
        In the code sample below, we have implemented a simple number-guessing game.  The computer chooses a random number and then asks the player to guess the random number.  The code is available in
        <a class="run" href="/main-labs/prog-new/snap/conditionals/guess-number.xml">this file</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" title="Number Guesser Starter" alt="Number Guesser Starter" src="/main-labs/img/prog/guess-number.png" >
      </p>
      <p class="alert quoteBlue">
        Notice the way that the blue <code>ask</code> block is used to get input from the user (the person playing the game).  The value that they enter is stored in the <code>answer</code> variable. This variable is updated each time the <code>ask</code> block is run by the script.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is not that cool yet.  You will be making the game much more like
        playing the number-guessing game with a person!
