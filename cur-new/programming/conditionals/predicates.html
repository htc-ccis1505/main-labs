	    We can also make our own <em>predicate</em>, a kind of block that reports either <code>true</code>
	    or <code>false</code>.
  </p>
  <div class="alert quoteGreen">
    Let's make a new "greater than or equal to" (<code>&gt;=</code>) operator.
	  <br><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/5ge3.png" alt="5 &gt;= 3"><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/5ge5.png" alt="5 &gt;=
	5"><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/3ge5.png" alt="3 &gt;= 5">
</div>
	<p>
	    This isn't really a hard problem, but we've learned from experience that many students have a hard time with
	    it at first. So here are some suggestions if you get stuck.
	</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>
		Make sure that you choose the hexagonal <code> predicate</code> block shape in the initial <code> Make a
		block</code> dialog.
	    </li>
	    <br>
	    <li>
		This is an <em>infix</em> operator, i.e., the
		<code>
		    &gt;=
		</code>
		block name goes between the two input slots. So you'll have to use the left plus sign in the Block
		Editor.
	    </li>
	    <br>
	    <li>
		You'll probably find the Boolean operators helpful, although they're not entirely necessary:
		<br>
		<br>
		<img src="/main-labs/img/prog/Booleans.png" alt="and, or, not blocks">
	    </li>
	    <br>
	    <li>
		There are several correct ways to do this! It's okay if your answer is different from another group's
		answer, as long as it gives the right <code> true</code> and <code> false</code> answers.
	    </li>
	</ol>

	    If you <em>do</em> have trouble with this problem, don't feel bad.  Try to understand what's getting in the way and work through it.  If you're really stuck, we've got solutions on the next page...
