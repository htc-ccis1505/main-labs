    Now that we know how to create variables, how do we use them? Both script variables and global variables are used in similar ways.
  </p>

  <h2>Set and Get the Value</h2>
  <p>
    To set the value of variables, use the <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/set.png" alt="set (_) to (_)"/> block. This block stores the value on the right in the variable specified on the left.
  </p>

  <p>
    To access this value, use the rounded variable block (i.e. <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="(i)"/>). Here's a quick example:
    <br><br>
	  <img src="/main-labs/img/variables/player-lives.png" alt="set lives to 5; say (join words ('Hello, player! You have) (lives) ('lives remaining'))"/>
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteBlue">
	  Note that the <code>join words</code> block allows you to combine multiple strings of text into one separated by a space. If it's not already in your project, you can add it by clicking the file icon in the toolbar and then select "Import tools".
  </p>

  <h2>Increment Value</h2>
  <p>
    Often you will want to increase or decrease the value of the variable by a fixed amount. To do this, you can use the <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/change.png" alt="change (_) by (_)"/> block. This will change the variable on the left by the amount on the right.  To increase the value, use a positive number.  To decrease the value, use a negative number.
