			For this activity, you will create the <em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em> game described on the previous page.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteBlue">
			You may use any two costumes/sprites you like - it doesn't have to be the cat & dog.  There are a lot of sprite "Costumes" that you can import from the Snap! File menu. The cat shown is "Cat 4" and the dog is "Dog 2b".
		</p>

		<p>
			This script will use two different sprites. When the space bar key is pressed , each sprite will choose a random number to indicate rock, paper or scissors, and then say their choice.  (It may be easiest to get the script working for the first sprite, and then duplicate that code for the second sprite.)
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteBlue">
			For a variable to be visible across many sprites, it is helpful to use a global variable instead of a script variable. However, you should <i>prefer</i> script variables when this behavior is not needed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once you have this working, add a third sprite. After the first two sprites pick their choice and say it, the third sprite should say who wins. To allow the sprites time to make their choice, have this third sprite wait for 1 second before deciding who wins.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may find <a href="/main-labs/img/prog/RPS.pdf" target="new">this chart</a> useful.
		</p>
		<p>
			Add two additional variables that keep track of how many times each character has won. You can make these variables visible on the stage by clicking on the check-box next to the variable name. Make sure that these reset to zero each time the green flag is clicked.
		</p>

		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>The minimum requirements for this script are that it:</strong>
			<br> - starts when the green flag button is clicked
			<br> - sets a <em>hidden</em> variable for each sprite to a random number between 1 and 3 when the script starts and then uses that variable to determine which word each sprite should say
			<br> - sets <em>visble</em> variables to show how many times each sprite has won
		</p>
