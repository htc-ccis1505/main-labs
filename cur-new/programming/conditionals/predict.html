	    Below are several blocks that use <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code>. Predict what each one will do and discuss it with your partner. Once you've done this, you can try running each of the blocks, which can be found in <a target="_blank" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:http://htc-ccis1505.github.io/main-labs/prog-new/snap/conditionals/predict-if-functions.xml">this script</a>.

	    You'll notice that a couple of the scripts below use the <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/abs.png"
	    alt="abs ()"/> block. This block actually allows you to use many different mathematical functions. It shows
	    up in the palette as <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/sqrt-of-10.png" alt="sqrt (10)"/>. Just
	    click the drop-down menu to select which function to use. "abs" is short for "absolute value." In case
	    you're not already familiar, the absolute value of a number is just that number turned positive. For
	    example, <code>abs(10)</code> is just <code>10</code>, while <code>abs(-2.5)</code> is <code>2.5</code>.
