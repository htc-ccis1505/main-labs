    Previously we have used loop blocks to count down from a number.

  <p>
    This code uses a loop and a counter to say each number from 5 to 0. Each time through the loop, we say the number (i), then decrease i by one.
  </p>
  <p>
    This code uses the for loop structure to control when the loop will stop. When i reaches the boundary value (number following the word to), the loop ends.
  </p>
  <p>
    We could also write this code using a counter variable and a repeat until loop.
