        <h2>Intro Homework Lab</h2>
        <p>
            For this next lab, you will once again just fill in some code below the comments in the <a href="/main-labs/prog-new/python/more_python.py">welcome.py</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure to set your name in the <code>your_name</code> variable at the top. (Surely you are not a silly student.)
        </p>
        <p>

          If you'd like it to be a little neater you could add code to print a blank line and a message to the start of each exercise, but that isn't required.
