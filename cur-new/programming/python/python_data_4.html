      This section deals with mining of words through conditional frequency analysis and plotting data.

  	<h2>Frequency Analysis</h2><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
	  <p>
	     Here's a little secret: much of NLP (and data science, for that matter) boils down to counting things. If you've got a bunch of data that needs analyzin' but you don't know where to start, counting things is usually a good place to begin. Sure, you'll need to figure out exactly what you want to count, how to count it, and what to do with the counts, but if you're lost and don't know what to do, just start counting.

    <p>
    	To match the original experiment we are emulating, lets slice the corpus down to the first 35,000 words.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
>>> short_corpus = the_corpus[:35000]
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Exercise 1 - Unique Words</h3>
    <p>We can now go ahead an figure out the number of unique words used in Jay Z's first 35,000 lyrics.</p>

    <p>A set is an unordered collection that has no duplicate elements. Python provides a <code>set</code> function to get the unique items from a list.</p>
    <pre><code>
>>> mylist = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]
>>> myset = set(mylist)
>>> print myset
set([1, 2, 3])
    </code></pre>

    <p>Edit the lexical_diversity.py file.  Look for Exercise 1. Write the funciton to determine the number of unique words in a corpus.</p>

    <h3>Exercise 2 - Lexical Diversity</h3>
    <p>Next we will calculate the lexical diversity of Jay Z's lyrics.  We define lexical diversity as the total number of words divided by the number of unique words.</p>
    <p>To write this function we need two values:
      <br>1. The total number of words, we've said we will use 35,000 for this experiment, but we want to be able to use this function for other data as well. So we need to know how many words are in the data passed in as input.  Think about the data structure used, and then how we can get the total number of words.
      <br>2. The number of unique words.  This is easy, as we wrote that function above.
    </p>
    <p>Edit the lexical_diversity.py file.  Look for Exercise 2. Write the funciton to determine the number of unique words in a corpus.</p>

    <p>
      Now, if we call our function on the Jay Z sliced corpus, it should give us a score.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
>>> lexical_diversity.lexical_diversity(short_corpus)
6
    </code></pre>

    <p>The lexical diversity of Jay Z's first 35,000 lyrics is 6.
    </p>

      This section exercise asks you to work with additional nltk data.  If you did not download this earlier, you should do so now.
      To do this, in a python interpreter import nltk then enter the command <code>nltk.download()</code>. This will open a window, or show a command list in your python environment. Go ahead and download the book collection - "Everything used in the NLTK Book".
    </p>


	  <h3>Exercise 3 - Explore</h3>
    <p>In this exercise you will write code, to explore and compare the lexical diversity of the King James Bible and Jane Austen's Emma to the lyrics of JayZ.
    <p>
      First we must learn to work with the Gutenberg data.  We can get a list of the available files by using the <code>fileids</code> function:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
>>> nltk.corpus.gutenberg.fileids()
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      Then we can get a list of words in a corpus by using the <code>words</code> function.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
>>> emma = nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('austen-emma.txt')
    </code></pre>

    <p>Compare the lexical diversity of JayZ's lyrics to Emma, and the King James Bible.  Feel free to explore and compare other data sets as well. Output the results, similar to:</p>
    <pre><code>
The lexical diversity score of JayZ's lyrics is  10
The lexical diversity score of emma is  24
The lexical diversity score of the King James Bible is  73
    </code></pre>
