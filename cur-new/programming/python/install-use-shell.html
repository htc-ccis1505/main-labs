            This section provides information regarding how to run python and use a command prompt on your computer.  We've done our best to provide information for all major operating systems (although it's easier on some systems than on others).
        </p>
        <h2>Install Python</h2>
        <p>
          This is done for you on the lab computers.
        </p>

        <h3>On Windows:</h3>
        <p>
          Go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python.org Downloads</a> to download the installer.  You may also find the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html">Windows FAQ</a> helpful, as well as this information on <a href="http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=960000&fromSeriesID=96">Adding Python to the path</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>On Mac OS X:</h3>
        <p>
            Python is installed on some OS X computers by default. While that version may not be the latest, it should serve just fine for the purposes of this class.
            Check using the terminal as described below first.
        </p>
        <p>
            If needed, you can install python by getting <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">XCode</a> from the Apple Store or by installing the smaller
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/">Command Line Tools</a>. (Apple account required.)  If you plan to program on a Mac, at a minimum, those command line tools are very helpful.
            The full install of XCode is much larger and includes an editor and tools for other languages.
        </p>
        <h2>Open Command Prompt</h2>
        <h3>On Windows:</h3>
        <p>
            Windows allows you to perform many common actions, like creating or navigating folders and launching applications, from what is called the CMD command prompt.
            Do a search for for cmd.exe on your computer (Click the Start button and type in cmd.) and run it.
            <b>Note:</b> Python may not be set up properly on windows. If you are unable to get python to work from the command
            line (as explained below) here is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/faq/windows.html" target="_blank">link</a> that will help you get things set up.
        </p>
        <h3>On Mac OS X:</h3>
        <p>
            The Terminal window is like a text-based version of your computer. From here, many common actions, like creating or navigating folders and launching applications,
            can be performed via the command line. On Mac and Linux, the Terminal application can be accessed from the Applications folder under Utilities or using a quick-search function.
        </p>

        <h2>Running Python</h2>
        <p class="alert quoteBlue">
          <strong>Note</strong>: The version of Python being used in this lab is Python 2.7. On your own computer,
          you may have a different version. Try loading <code>python3</code> to see if you have version 3.
          There are a few differences between Python 2.x and 3.x, but everything in these lab should work well
          in both versions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The next step is to open the Python "interpreter". Open the command prompt or terminal.
            In the classroom, you will need to first go to the python27 directory.
            To do this type <code>cd C:\Python27</code>.
            Then type <code>python</code> and hit the <code>return</code> key.
            You should see something similar to the following:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
C:\Users\Student> cd C:\python27
C:\Python27> python
Python 2.7.8 (default, Jun 30 2014, 16:08:48) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win
32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
        </code></pre></p>
        <br />

        <p>
            The <code>>>></code> indicates where to enter python code. After typing a line of code, hitting the <code>Enter</code> key will tell the python interpreter to run
            the instruction you entered.  Try typing the following into the interpreter:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> 3 + 5
8
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
            If the text cursor is on a line beginning with <code>>>></code>, the command line window has an active python interpreter open.
            <b>From here you won't be able to run any other command.</b> To leave the python interpreter type the exit command <code>exit()</code> and hit the <code>Enter</code> key.
        <p><pre><code>
>>> exit()
C:\Python27>
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
            Any functions or variables created in the python interpreter are erased when the <code>exit()</code> command is run.
        </p>
