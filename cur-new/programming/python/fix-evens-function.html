        <h3>Fix the Even Numbers Function</h3>
        <p>
            When we ran the lab script by entering <code>python functions.py first_even_nums 5</code>, we got the first <em>4</em> even numbers printed out.  If the function worked correctly, it should print the first <em>5</em> even numbers.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
C:\PythonLab> python functions.py first_even_nums 5
2
4
6
8
        </code></pre></p>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
          <strong>Fix it!</strong>
          <br>
          Open the lab file in your editor and update the <code>your_name</code> variable.  Then scroll down to exercise 1 and the function called <code>first_even_nums</code>. We need to update the code so that we get the correct behavior and see the even numbers up to 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          To fix the code, look carefully at the <code>while</code> loop.  When does the loop end?  How can we change that to get one more number printed?
        </p>
        <p>
          When the code works correctly, you should see that it prints the even numbers from 2 to 10.

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
          <strong>Try it!</strong>
          <br>
          How do you think you could print 10 numbers instead of 5?  (Hint: You do not need to change the python code to do this.)
