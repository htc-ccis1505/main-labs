        <h2>Intro Lab</h2>
        <p>
            For this first lab, you will just fill in some code below the comments in the welcome.py file that we looked at earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you initially run the file, it will just welcome you by name.  (If it isn't showing your name, you need to set the <code>your_name</code> variable.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
Welcome to Python Mary
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
          As you work through the lab, you will add code for each part.  Then as you save and re-run the file, you will see output from any print statements that you add.  When you are done, it should look something like what follows:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
Welcome to Python Mary
Mary just cannot wait to learn python!

        <p>
          If you'd like it to be a little neater you could add code to print a blank line and a message to the start of each exercise, but that isn't required.
        </p>
