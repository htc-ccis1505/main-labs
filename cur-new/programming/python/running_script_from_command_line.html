    		Before we can start writing Python code, it is helpful need to learn a few shell commands.

        If you are working on Windows, be sure that you are using PowerShell.

    	<h3>How files are organized on a computer:</h3>
    	<p>
    		As you probably already know, your python files, and any file for that matter, can be found within a particular folder (also know as a directory) on your computer in a structure similar to the one shown below:
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<img style="float:left padding-bottom: 5px" src="/main-labs/img/python/file_system_image.jpg"/>
    	</p>
    	<h3>Shell Commands</h3>
    	<p style="clear:both">
    		To navigate to a particular python file we may need to make use of the following shell commands. (Whenever we say "enter a command" this means type the command and then press enter to execute it).
    	</p>
    	<ol>
    	<li>
    			<p>
    				The command <code>ls</code> allows you to view a list of all of the files and directories that are located in your current directory.
    			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				  <p>
  					To change directories use the <code>cd</code> command followed by the directory name or path.
            Notice that you (typically) see the current directory name in the shell window prompt.
				</p>
				<p>
					  If we need to move back out of our directory we can enter the command <code>cd ..</code>
            which will move up one directory.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
			     Finally, to make a directory, enter the command <code>mkdir</code> followed by the directory name to create a directory.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
