    		So far you've seen how to run python from the command line (also known as a shell) via the interpreter; however, we can also write our code in a separate text file, which we can save and then run from the command line. This is how most people create python programs.  However, before we can start writing more Python, it is helpful need to learn a few shell commands.

        Some of the commands introduced here are different between a Windows computer and Mac OS X or Unix/Linux computer.

    	<h3>How files are organized on a computer:</h3>
    	<p>
    		As you probably already know, your python files, and any file for that matter, can be found within a particular folder (also know as a directory) on your computer in a structure similar to the one shown below:
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		<img style="float:left padding-bottom: 5px" src="/main-labs/img/python/file_system_image.jpg"/>
    	</p>
    	<br>
    	<p style="clear:both">
    		To navigate to a particular python file we may need to make use of the following shell commands. (Whenever we say "enter a command" this means type the command and then press enter to execute it).
    	</p>
    	<ol>
    	<li>
    			<p>
    				The command <code>dir</code> (or on Mac <code>ls</code>) allows you to view a list of all of the files
            and directories that are located in your current directory.
    			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				  <p>
  					To change directories (on either OS) use the <code>cd</code> command followed by the directory name or path.
            Notice that you (typically) see the current directory name in the shell window prompt.
				</p>
				<p>
					  If we need to move back out of our directory we can enter the command <code>cd ..</code>
            which will move up one directory.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
			     Finally, to make a directory, enter the command <code>mkdir</code> followed by the directory name to create a directory.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
