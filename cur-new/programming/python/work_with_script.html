        <h2>Running the Lab Script</h2>
        <h3>Get the starter file</h3>
        <p>
            Now it's time to seriously write some code. Start by right clicking on this link to get the <a href="/main-labs/prog-new/python/welcome.py">welcome.py</a> starter file and select save as to save it to a directory on your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the <code>cd</code> command to go to the directory where you saved the file. Then use the <code>ls</code> command to verify that you are in the correct directory with the welcome file.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
C:\Users\Staff> cd C:\myDirectory
C:\myDirectory> ls
welcome.py
        </code></pre></p>

        <h3>Edit the File</h3>
        <p>
            We will be editing the python file in a text editor. There are many text editors available, any will do.  In this lab we'll be using <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> which should be installed the lab computers, and it is free to install on your home computers as well.  Another good, free option is <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            First, open up your editor and then open welcome.py. Make sure to read the comments at the top of the file. Then set the variable called <code>your_name</code> just below the comments. For example, <code>your_name = "Alonzo"</code> (make sure your name is inside quotes as this is how Python designates text).
        </p>
        <p>
            Head back to the shell and you can try running this file by entering <code>python welcome.py</code> as shown below:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
C:\myDirectory> python welcome.py
        </code></pre></p>

        <p>
          At this point, all it will do is welcome you by name. (Unless you have forgotten to update the your_name variable...)  Later you will complete the lab by adding code below each comment.
