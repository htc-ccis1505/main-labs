        <h2>Running the Lab Script</h2>
        <h3>Get the starter file</h3>
        <p>
            Now it's time to seriously write some code. Start by right clicking on this link to get the <a href="/main-labs/prog/python/welcome.py">welcome.py</a> starter file and select save as to save it
            to a directory on your computer. If you are working in the lab, save this to the C:\Python27 directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Head back to the shell and enter the <code>dir</code> command to make sure that the file made it into our Python27 directory.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
C:\Python27> dir
virus.py
        </code></pre></p>

        <h3>Edit the File</h3>
        <p>
            We will be editing the python file in something called a text editor (guess what a text editor does...).
            There are many text editors available, any will do.  In this lab we'll be using <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> which should be installed the lab computers, and it is free to install on your home computers as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, open up Brackets and then open welcome.py. Make sure to read the comments at the top of the file and then take a brief glance at the code, but don't worry about it too much for right now.
            Also, make sure to set the variable called <code>your_name</code> just below the comments. For example, <code>your_name = "Alonzo"</code> (make sure your name is inside quotes as this is how Python designates text).
        </p>
        <p>
            Head back to the shell and you can try running this file by entering <code>python welcome.py</code> as shown below:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
C:\Python27> python welcome.py
        </code></pre></p>

        <h3>Even Numbers</h3>
        <p>
            Next try running the first exercise by entering <code>python welcome.py first_even_nums 5</code> (if it's working this should print the first 5 even numbers, starting with the number 2):
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
C:\Python27> python welcome.py first_even_nums 5
2
4
6
8
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
            Uh oh...it looks like we've only printed the first 4 even numbers. Head back to Sublime and edit the function called <code>first_even_nums</code> so that we get the correct behavior:
        </p>
                <p><pre><code>
C:\Python27> python welcome.py first_even_nums 5
2
4
6
8
10
        </code></pre></p>
