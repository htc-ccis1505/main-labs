        <h3>Exercise 3</h3>
        <p>
            Find exercise 3 in the functions.py file and modify the function <code>reverse_string(string)</code> that takes in a string and have print the string in the reverse order as shown below:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> reverse_string("Awesome")
'emosewA'

        </code></pre></p>
        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            You'll want to use some sort of loop, along with some of the things that you've learned about strings to do this.  When you think your function works, run the tests that we have provided by entering the following command into the shell:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
python functions.py reverse_string
        </code></pre></p>

    </body>
