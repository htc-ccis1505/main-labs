        <h3>Return Values</h3>
        <p>
          In <span class="snap">snap</span> speak) we made reporter blocks and predicate blocks that could report back a value. In python, functions that we write are also able to report back values, but we say that the function <em>returns</em> a value instead of reports a value. This corresponds to the word <code>return</code> which is used in python (and many other languages).
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> def add(x, y):
...    return x + y

>>> print add(2,3)
5
        </code></pre></p>


        <h3>Exercise 2</h3>
        <p>
            Find Exercise 2 in the functions.py file and add the code to the <code>exponent(num, power)</code> function that has been defined for you.  Notice that it takes two arguments (a number and an exponent value) and returns the computed result. Below are a few example inputs.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> exponent(10, 0)
1
>>> exponent(5, 3)
125
>>> exponent(2, 10)
1024
      </code></pre></p>
      <p class="alert quoteOrange">
        For exponent, any value with 0 as the exponent should give you the result of 1.  For any other exponent, that tells you how many times to multiply the number by itself.  So exponent(5, 3) = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.
      </p>
      <p>
          To test your function, type the following into the command line:
      </p>
      <p><pre><code>
python functions.py exponent
      </code></pre></p>
      <p class="alert quoteBlue">
          This will run a series of tests to validate the functionality of your exponent definition. Check the output to make sure it worked!
