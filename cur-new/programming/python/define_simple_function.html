         <strong>Warning on Spacing</strong>
         <br /> In python, spacing is absolutely critical.  After a <code>:</code>,
         the next line must be indented, use the same number of spaces consistently.
         <strong>Do NOT use tabs</strong> unless your editor will convert them to spaces for your.
         Many programming editors will do this.  Check this setting in Brackets at the bottom of the editor.
         It should say spaces not tab.

        <h2>Defining a Function</h2>
        <p>
            Defining a function in Python is easy! In your text editor, a simple count-up python function may look like this (to the right is the exact same function written in snap):
        </p>
        <table style="width:auto; table-height:200px">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="/main-labs/img/python/simple_python_function_colored.png"/>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="/main-labs/img/python/count_up_function.png"/>
              </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Function Header</h3>
        <p>
          Like in <span class="snap">snap</span>, the function header specifies the name of the function,
          and any arguments (inputs, or parameters) into the function. Notice the line must begin with the
          keyword <code>def</code> and end with a <code>:</code>. This lets the interpreter know that the
          indented lines that follow are part of a function definition.
        </p>
        <p class="alert alert-warning">
          In <span class="snap">snap</span> it's common to have text between function parameters, such as the
          <img src="/main-labs/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="Snap! mod block" />. In Python, all parameters must
          come at the end of a function, between <code>()</code>.
        </p>
        <h3><code>For</code> Loop</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>for</code> loop in Python works similarly to our <span class="snap">snap</span>
          <code>for</code> loop with some key differences. To have the index variable <code>i</code> increment
          from <code>1 to num</code>, we have to create an <b>iterable</b>. An iterable is a just list of items.
          Starting with the first item, <code>i</code> takes each consecutive item of the list as its value.
          The <code>range(x, y)</code> function receives two numbers and returns a list of all numbers beginning
          with <code>x</code> and ending with <code>y-1</code>.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> list(range(2, 6))
[2, 3, 4, 5]
        </code></pre></p>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            <strong>NOTE</strong>: The list returned by range(x,y) does NOT include y.
        </p>
