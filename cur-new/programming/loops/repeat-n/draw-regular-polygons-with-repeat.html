  <title>Drawing regular polygons with <code>repeat</code></title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>
    A regular polygon is a shape in which all the sides are the same length and all the turning angles are the same.
     If the sides are different lengths or if the angels are different, then it is called an irregular polygon.  A square is a regular 4-sided polygon, but a rectangle is an irregular polygon.

  <p>
    Use what you learned from drawing a square and  use the <img src="/main-labs/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="empty repeat-n block" class="inline" /> to draw the following regular shapes:
    <br>- Equilateral Triangle
    <br>- Pentagon (5 sides)
    <br>- Hexagon (6 sides)
    <br>- Octagon (8 sides)
  </p>

      Save the scripts as you go because, in a following activity, you'll be trying to figure out a pattern.
  </p>
  <p >
    As you draw regular polygons with more and more sides, you are getting closer and closer to a circle.
    <br>Is there a point at which it is actually (mathematically) a circle? Can you modify the script to make a circle?
