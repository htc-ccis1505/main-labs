  <title>Drawing regular polygons with <code>repeat</code></title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>
    Remember that a regular polygon is a shape in which all the sides are the same length and all the turning angles are the same. This makes them easy to draw using a repeat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use what you learned from drawing a square and use the <img src="/main-labs/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="empty repeat-n block" class="inline" /> to draw the following regular shapes:
    <br>- Equilateral Triangle (3 sides)
    <br>- Pentagon (5 sides)
    <br>- Hexagon (6 sides)
    <br>- Octagon (8 sides)
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteOrange">
      Save the scripts as you go because, in a following activity, you'll be trying to figure out a pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you draw each shape, think about the relationship between the number of sides and the angle that you turn.  As you have more sides, does the angle increase or decrease?
  </p>

    <b>Challenge</b><br>
    As you draw polygons with more and more sides, you are getting closer and closer to a circle. Is there a point at which it is actually (mathematically) a circle? Can you modify the script to make a circle?
