    A regular polygon is a shape in which all the sides are the same length and all the turning angles are the same. A square is a regular polygon because it has 4 sides of the same length, and 4 angels of the same size.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the sides are different lengths <i>or</i> if the angels are different, then it is called an irregular polygon.  A rectangle is an irregular polygon because not all 4 sides have the same length. Another irregular polygon is a parallelogram, which is similar to a rectangle but the angles are also different.

    In this lab we will draw some regular polygons and try to find a pattern for how they are drawn. This will allow us to easily draw polygons with any number of sides.
