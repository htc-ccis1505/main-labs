      Complete <a target="_blank" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:http://htc-ccis1505.github.io/main-labs/prog/drawing/draw-star-fill-in.xml">this code</a> (shown below) to draw a five-pointed star.
      <br>
      A star is closely related to a pentagon. Remember, that for a pentagon you use a turning angle of <code>72</code>.

  </div>

  <p class="alert quoteOrange">
    In the code above, we use the <code>turn</code> block <u>before</u> the <code>repeat</code> block so that the star isn't drawn tilted.  But, don't worry about this until you got the other <code>turn</code> block figured out.
