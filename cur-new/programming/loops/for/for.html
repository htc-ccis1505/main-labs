  <p>
    The numbers in the <code>for</code> block work as you probably think they do.  The inner script is run enough times to count from the left number (<code>1</code>) to the right number (<code>10</code>).  As with the <code>repeat</code> block, you can change the numbers it comes with by default to change the way the block repeats.

    What's new to you here, though, is the <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/variable-i.png">.  This <code>i</code> block is a <em>variable</em> that acts like a counter.  You use it any place you would use a number, and it will report the value that it currently holds. By using this <code>i</code>, your inner blocks can know which time through the loop they are currently on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Think of a <em>variable</em> like a box with a name&mdash;this one has the name <code>i</code>.  This box is made for you by the <code>for</code> block, and holds a different number each time through the loop.  The first time it will hold <code>1</code>, or whatever is the left number in the <code>for</code> block.  Each time the loop repeats, the value of <code>i</code> is increased by 1.

    You use it by dragging <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/variable-i.png">
    from the <i>source</i> within the <code>for</code> block down to the slot in which you will use it. For instance:
