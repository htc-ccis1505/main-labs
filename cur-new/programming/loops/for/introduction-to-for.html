    Repeating a part of your program is a very common practice in programming.
    Sometimes, though, you want to do <em>almost</em> the same thing for a certain number of times, but with a slight variation.
  </p>
  <p>For instance:
      <br>  - You want to draw 20 squares on the screen, but each a different size.
      <br>  - You want to draw 100 polygons with different numbers of sides.
  </p>

  <p>
      These situations can often be handled by the <code>for</code> block, which is found near the bottom of the Control palette:
  </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/for.png" alt="for">
  </p>

  <p class="alert quoteGreen">
    NOTE: in the current version of <span class="snap">snap</span>, the <code>for</code> block isn't installed automatically. You will need to import it once for each new <span class="snap">snap</span> project in which you use it. To do so, click on the <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/sys/button-file-menu.png"> icon at the top of the screen and select <code>Import Tools</code>.)
