  <title>Using the REPEAT UNTIL block</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Let's try making some blocks using <img class="inline" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" alt="empty repeat-until block" />
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteOrange">Remember that the statement following the repeat <i>must</i> evaluate to a Boolean <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
  <p>
    Write a <b>reporter block</b> that can be used to get a person's name.
  </p>
  <p>
    The block should ask the person to enter their name. If no value is given or if less than 2 characters were entered, tell them that they must enter at least two characters and then ask again. Continue asking until a valid name is entered, then report their name.
