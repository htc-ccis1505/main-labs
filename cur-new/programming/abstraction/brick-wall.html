	<h2>Abstraction</h2>

	<p>
		Sometimes, when we write programs and scripts, it feels like we have hit a brick wall.  (This is a good sign; if a project isn't hard, you're not stretching your mind!)  Now, you are going to draw this brick wall:
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" title="Sample image of brick wall" alt="Sample image of brick wall" src="/main-labs/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/wall.png"></span>
	</p>

	<p>
		While <span class="snap">snap</span> has lots of blocks for drawing and moving, it doesn't have anything about bricks. It wouldn't make sense to have one in general because most programs don't involve bricks. But ones that do could really use a <img src="/main-labs/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="draw-brick"> block. <img src="/main-labs/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png" \="" }="" alt="draw-brick"> moves us away from having to talk in the computer's terms and closer to using the terms of the problem we're trying to solve. The process of moving from what the programming language gives you to a natural language (one that humans speak to communicate ) is critical to a good abstraction.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this problem, you will build an abstraction for drawing a brick wall, first by creating <img src="/main-labs/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="draw-brick">, then blocks for drawing rows, and ultimately the goal: <img src="/main-labs/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-n">.
