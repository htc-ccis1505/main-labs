	<h2>Drawing One Brick</h2>

	<p>
		A brick is a solid red rectangle ("brick red," i.e., not a bright primary-color red but somewhat darker).  There's no "draw rectangle" block in <span class="snap">snap</span>, but we can fake it by thinking of a rectangle as a very thick line.  You know how to draw a line, with the <b>move</b> block. In the <b>Pen</b> palette there's a <b>set pen size</b> block.  We can use it to draw a thick line:</p>

		<span style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" title="code for brick" alt="Code for draw brick" src="/main-labs/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick-code.png"></span>

		<p>
			If you try out this block, you'll notice that your brick has rounded ends.  These ends stick out beyond the length of the line you asked to draw.  Here's a picture of the rounded brick with a regular line (pen size 1) inside it:
		</p>

		<span style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" title="round brick" alt="Round brick" src="/main-labs/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/round-brick.png"></span>

		<p>
			These rounded ends are very pretty when drawing most pictures, but they don't look like bricks, and they make thinking about lengths in this project too complicated.  So for this project you're going to turn off the rounded ends.  Click on the settings button (<img src="/main-labs/img/sys/settings.png" alt="settings button">) in the toolbar, and turn on the "<b>Flat line ends</b>" setting.
