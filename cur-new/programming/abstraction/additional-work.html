	<h2>Additional Exercises</h2>

	<p>You should now have a block that will draw a brick wall like this:</p>
	<p>
		<span style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" title="Sample image of brick wall" alt="Sample image of brick wall" src="/main-labs/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/wall.png"></span>
	</p>

	<p>
		After you've drawn the original brick wall shown below at the top of this page, add more inputs to the <b>Draw a Brick Wall</b> block so that we can modify the wall that is drawn:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Length of the wall (how many bricks)</li>
		<li>Length of a brick</li>
		<li>Mortar thickness</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Add these one at a time, not all at once!  When you modify the length of a brick, that should also change the length of a half-brick. When you modify the mortar thickness, that should also change the distance between rows (since that's mortar too).
