		<h1>Let's make some noise! </h1>
		<p>
				You don't have to sing, but we are going to make some noise as we experiment with the sound blocks.
		</p>

		<h2>Sound Palette</h2>
		<p>
			Take a look at the blocks that are on the sound palette.  We haven't used them before, but try to figure out what they do.  For example, the <code>play note () for () beats</code> block, will play a numerical MIDI music note.  See what you can do with this and the other blocks to make a little music, or at least some noise.
		</p>

		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>
			This is a pretty open ended assignment, so have fun with it. However, don't feel like you need to write a pop hit or a symphony.
		</p>
		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>The minimum requirements for this script are that it:</strong>
			<br> - starts when the green flag button is clicked
			<br> - uses a new costume for a sprite
			<br> - has an interesting sequence of about 15-20 Sound and/or Looks blocks
			<br> - must make (more than one) noise
		</p>

		<p>
			Keep in mind real music is totally optional, but if you do want to try to make those notes musical, then this <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/MIDI_Notes">Scratch MIDI article</a> may help.
		</p>

		<h2>Sounds &amp; Costumes</h2>
		<p>
			If you want more than MIDI notes, there is an option to import sounds from the file menu.  That will add sounds to the <code>play sound</code> block dropdown menu.

		<p>
			There is also an option to import Costumes for the sprite from the file menu as well. There are tabs for both Costumes and Sounds in the Scripting Area (that center area of Snap where you put your blocks). The Looks palette has blocks to support changing the costume while the program is running too.
		</p>

		<h2>Share!</h2>
		<p>
			If you want, feel free to share your amazing singing sprites with the rest of the class in the chat room. For this assignment, sharing your singing sprite is officially OK.  However, it's never OK to copy or submit someone else's work as your own. I expect everyone's singing sprite to be different and unique.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
				Be careful doing this with other assignments, as it could allow someone to copy your work!  Remember - if there are duplicate (or near duplicate) assignments or parts of assignments, neither person will get credit for the work.
		</p>

		<h2>Export and Submit</h2>
		<p>
			When everything works as you expect, export your script (refer back to the inclass lab if you need help) and upload that to the lab dropbox in D2L.
