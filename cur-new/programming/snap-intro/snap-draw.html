		<h1>Snap Draw</h1>
		<p>
				We're going to build a simple drawing program.  We'll have the sprite be our pen and have it follow the mouse around the stage.  We'll use the up and down arrow keys to control when the pen is up or down and will use letter keys to change the pen color.
		</p>

		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>When complete, your script must:</strong>
			<br> - start when the green flag button is clicked
			<br> - clear the screen and have the cursor follow the mouse when the script starts
			<br> - the down arrow should put the pen down to start drawing
			<br> - the up arrow should pick the pen up to stop drawing
			<br> - use 4 different letter keys to change the pen color
			<br> - (optional) use the right and left arrow keys to change the pen size
		</p>

		<h2>Block Intro</h2>
		<p>We will use the following blocks to build this program:</p>
		<img src="/main-labs/img/lab1-hw/snap-draw-all-blocks.png" alt="Image of blocks used" /><br/>

		<p>
			Most of these blocks were introduced in the in-class lab.  Try to figure out what the new blocks do by using them.
		</p>

		<h2>Step 1: Clear and Follow</h2>
		<p>
			Start by clearing the screen when the program starts (green flag). Then make the sprite follow the mouse.  We did that earlier in the in-class lab.  Try to remember how that worked and recreate it here.  If you get stuck you can always go back and look at the in-class lab.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
				Before going to the next step, think about what your script should do right now.  Test your script to make sure it is working as you expect and fix any issues so that it works correctly before moving on.
		</p>

		<h2>Step 2: Pen up and down</h2>
		<p>
			Once you have the sprite following the mouse, we want to use the up and down arrow keys to control the pen, so that it is not always drawing a line.  Figure out how to pick up the pen when the up arrow key is pressed and put the pen down when the down arrow key is pressed.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
				Before going to the next step, think about what your script should do now. It should do everything it did before, plus what you added in this step. Test your script again to make sure both the old and new behavior it is working as you expect before moving on.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteBlue">
			Woo-hoo!  You now have the main part of the program working!  Now it's just adding improvements to the base functionality.
		</p>

		<h2>Step 3: Add some color</h2>
		<p>
			Add at least <strong>4 different</strong> pen colors.  Use <strong>letters of the alphabet</strong> to trigger the color change. For example when the g key is pressed, switch to green.  When the r key is pressed, switch to red.  Pick your favorite colors and shades.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
				Before going to the next step, test again.  Make sure to test both the new and old behavior and test different combinations of using the pen up and down while switching colors.
		</p>

		<h2>Extra: Pen Size</h2>
		<p class="alert quoteBlue">
			Assignments will often have extras.  They aren't required, but will count as "bonus" points which are applied at the end of the semester as discussed in the syllabus.  If you do an extra, make sure to call it out in the D2L dropbox notes when you submit the assignment so it isn't overlooked.
		</p>
		<p>
			See if you can figure out how to change the pen size (so it draws with a thicker or thinner line) when the left and right arrow keys are pressed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since this is a user interface control, make sure that you are consistent in the amount that you increase and decrease the pen size by. If you increase by 10 when the right arrow is clicked, don't have the size decrease by 2 when the left arrow is clicked.  Can you imagine how frustrating it would be if your sound control did that?
		</p>


		<h2>Export and Submit</h2>
		<p>
			When everything works as you expect, export your script (refer back to the inclass lab if you need help) and upload that to the lab dropbox in D2L.
