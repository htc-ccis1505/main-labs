        <p>
        	A sprite occupies a position (x,y) on the stage where x represents the horizontal position, from -240 (left) to 240 (right), and y represents the vertical position, from -180 (bottom) to 180 (top). Here's a picture:

    	<p>
    		The black sprite is at the center of the stage, called the origin, with coordinates (0, 0).
      </p>
      <p>
        The green sprite is to the right of the origin, so its x position is positive. The green sprite is also below the origin, so its y position is negative. Each grid line above represents 20 steps, so the green sprite's coordinates are (140, -100).

        Take some time to make sure you understand this.  What are the coordinates of the red sprite?
