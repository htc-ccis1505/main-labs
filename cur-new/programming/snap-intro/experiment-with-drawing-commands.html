  <p>
	   Try to get comfortable with the blocks under the <b>Motion</b> tab and the <b>Pen</b> tab. Figure out what each one does, and try to use these blocks to draw a square or a simple picture. Get started by testing these blocks:
  </p>
  <p>
  	<img class="indent" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/>
  </p>
  <p>
  	<img  class="indent" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/turn-right-15.png" alt="Turn Right 15 Degrees Block"/>
  </p>
  <p>
  	<img  class="indent" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/clear.png" alt="Clear Block"/>
  </p>
  <p>
  	<img  class="indent" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/pen-up.png" alt="Pen Down Block"/>
  </p>
  <p>
  	<img  class="indent" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/pen-down.png" alt="Pen Up Block"/>
  </p>
  <p>
	  Tips and Tricks:
	  <ol>
      <li>
        Once the pen is down, it stays down even in a different script. Use the <code>pen up</code> block to lift the pen to stop drawing.
      </li>
      <li>
			  To show the direction and the x and y position of the sprite, use the reporters from the bottom of the Motion palette.  You can  set these to be shown on the stage by clicking the check-box next to them, as described in the <a href="/main-labs/cur-new/programming/snap-intro/reporters.html">Reporters</a> activity you saw earlier in the lab.
		  </li>
  	</ol>
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteGreen">
    <strong>Try this:</strong> Does the <code>turn</code> block change the x or the y position?
