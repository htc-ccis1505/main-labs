    At the bottom of Motion palette are three blocks shaped differently from the others. These oval-shaped blocks are called <em>reporters</em>. The <img src="/main-labs/img/blocks/x-position.png" alt="X Position Sensor Block"/> and the
    <img src="/main-labs/img/blocks/y-position.png" alt="Y Position Sensor Block"/> reporters will tell you the position of your sprite on the stage. Move the sprite around and the values reported by these blocks change. As in algebra class, <b>x</b> means left-to-right position, and <b>y</b> means bottom-to-top position.
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteGreen">
    If your sprite is in the middle of the stage, drag it somewhere off-center.  Then, drag an <b>x position</b> block into the scripting area and click on it.  You should see a little speech balloon next to the block:
    <br>
    <img src="/main-labs/img/topic1/xpos-bubble.png" alt="X Position speech balloon"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Click on the gray check-box to the left of the <b>x position</b> block in the palette, and then look over to the stage. You will see that the value that the block would report is displayed on the stage:
  </p>
  <img src="/main-labs/img/topic1/palette-checkbox.png" alt="X Position block's checkbox"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="/main-labs/img/topic1/watcher.png" alt="X Position stage watcher"/>
  <p>This on-stage display is called a <em>watcher</em>.</p>
  <p class="alert quoteOrange">
    Unlike the <em>command</em> blocks we've used up until now, reporters don't carry out an action (such as moving the sprite or displaying a speech balloon) by themselves.  Instead they <em>report</em> a value, usually for use in another block's input slot.
