  <h2>Command Blocks</h2>
  <p>
    The blocks that we have been looking at so far are called <em>command</em> blocks.  The
    <img alt="move" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/move.png" />,
    <img alt="say" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/sayfor.png" />, and
    <img alt="turn" src="/main-labs/img/blocks/turn-left.png" />blocks are all command blocks.
  </p>
  <p>Notice that they are all jigsaw-puzzle-piece shaped, and they are able to snap together at both the top and bottom.  Command blocks are used to have <span class="snap">snap</span> carry out an action.  The actions happen sequentially, from top to bottom, one at a time.
  </p>

  <h2>Hat Blocks</h2>
  <p>
    In the script below, notice that the first block is a <em>hat</em> shaped block.
  </p>
  <img alt="when flag, pen down, repeat 4, move turn" src="/main-labs/img/prog/script.png" />
  <p>
    Hat block names typically start with the word "when", and they control <em>when</em> a script will be run.  In this example, the script should be run when the green flag near the right end of the Snap<em>!</em> toolbar is clicked.  Because of it's shape, the hat block can be used only at the top of the script and a script can't have more than one hat block.
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteOrange">
    Most hat blocks are found on the Control palette.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a script does not include a hat block, then the script will be run only if the user clicks on the script itself.  This is fine while you are experimenting, but when you are sharing a project with others you should always use hat blocks to start your scripts. This will ensure that the scripts are run as you intended.
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteOrange">
    It is a good practice to ensure that something always happens when the green flag in the toolbar is clicked, even if it is just giving instructions for what to do next.
