	<p>
    We saw variables used in the <code>for</code> block and as input parameters when making our own blocks.  But sometimes you need to use a variable in other places in your code.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use the <img src="/main-labs/img/prog/scriptvar.png" alt="script variables" /> block to create a variable, and the <img src="/main-labs/img/prog/set.png" alt="set" /> block to to give that variable a value. Both of these blocks are in the Variables palette. Here's an example:
  </p>
	<p><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/randompoly.png" alt="random polygon" /></p>
	<p>The <code>script variables</code> block creates a variable called <code>sides</code> (click on the orange
	'<code>a</code>' to change the name) that can be used throughout this script.
  </p>
  <p class="alert quoteOrange">
    Each time you click the green flag to run the script, a new variable is created, and it exists only during the time that the script is running.  The value is not retained after the script ends.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The <code>set</code> block says what value the variable should have. In this case, <span class="snap">snap</span>  will pick a random
  	integer value between 3 and 10 (inclusive). (The <code>pick random</code> block is in the Operators palette;
  	note that we changed the first input from 1 to 3.) The script will draw a regular polygon with that number of
  	sides. The value of <code>sides</code> is used twice, first in the <code>repeat</code> block to say how many
  	times the <code>move</code>-and-<code>turn</code> combination should be done, and again in computing the angle
  	through which to <code>turn</code> for each side.
  </p>
  <div class="alert quoteGreen">
    <p>
      Try making the script shown above.  Run it (by clicking the green flag) several times to see what shapes it draws.
    </p>

    <p>
      Self-test question: Why did we start the range of possible random numbers at 3?
    </p>

    <p>
      Self-test question: Where did the formula <img src="/main-labs/img/prog/360-over-sides.png" alt="360/sides" /> come from?
    </p>
    <p><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/repeat-random.png" alt="repeat (pick random)" /></p>
    <p>
      Self-test question: Try to explain before you run the script below what could go wrong if we just put
    	the <code>pick random</code> block in the script twice:
    </p>
    <p><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/bad-random-poly.png" alt="buggy random polygon" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>Another place where script variables can be useful is in a program that interacts with the user.</p>
	<p><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/converse.png" alt="conversation with ASK AND WAIT" /></p>
	<p>
    This script uses several blocks we haven't used before.  The <code>ask and wait</code> command and the <code>answer</code> reporter are in the Sensing palette. <code>Join</code> is in Operators. If you run the script you should be able to figure out what they do.
  </p>
	<p>
    Note that this script has <em>two </em>script variables. The <code>script variables</code> block has a little right-facing arrowhead at the end:
  </p>
	<p><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/arrowhead.png" alt="arrowhead in block" /></p>
	<p>
    If you click the arrowhead, a second orange variable oval will appear. Also, there will be left- and right-facing arrowheads. You can click these to adjust the number of variables you need.
  </p>
	<p>
    The join block also has arrowheads to control the number of input slots it has. In the text string inputs, both in <code>join</code> and in the <code>ask</code> blocks, the pale brown raised dots represent spaces. The brown dots don't appear in the text on the stage when the script is run. They're in the input slots so that you can easily see if there are multiple spaces in a row:
  </p>
	<p><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/multispace.png" alt="text input with multiple spaces in a row" /></p>
	<p>and also so that you can distinguish between a completely empty input slot and one that has a space in it:</p>
	<p><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/emptyspace.png" alt="empty input text vs. space" /></p>

  <p class="alert quoteOrange">
    You can use variable to hold values that may change in your script, or you can use a variable for something that may stay the same, but is used in many places. Variables whose values don't change are called <strong><em>constants</em></strong>.
    <br><br>
    We often create constants to hold messages or other values, perhaps a tax rate or a phone number. By using a variable for that value, if it later needs to change, you only need to update the code in one place.  Can you think of any other reasons using a variable for a constant value might be a good idea?
