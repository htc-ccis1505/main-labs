		With this brief introduction to the scratch interface, we begin to examine how sprites and blocks interact and effect one another.
		<br>
		<br>
		For example, the "play sound" blocks from earlier allow us to control when and how many sounds we here.
		<br>
		<br>
		Consider the difference between these two blocks?
		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/main-labs/img/prog/prog-play-sound-meow-BYOB.jpg" alt="Play Sound Meow" title="Play Sound Meow" >
		</div>
		<br>
		If you set up a small script like this:
		<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" title="meow" alt="meow" src="/main-labs/img/prog/play-sound-meow-3x.jpg" >
		<br>
		<br>
		How many meows do you you hear?
		<br>
		<br>
		How about one like this:
		<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" title="meow until done" alt="meow until done" src="/main-labs/img/prog/play-sound-meow-until-done-3x.jpg" >
		<br>
		<br>
		How many meows do you you hear now?
		<br>
		<br>
		Experiment with these blocks:
		<br>
		1) How about two "play sound [meow]" and then one "play sound [meow] until done"?
		<br>
		<img border="0" title="meow-meow-meow until done" alt="meow-meow-meow until done" src="/main-labs/img/prog/play-sound-meow-2x-then-until-done.jpg" >
		<br>
		<table width="201undefined">
			<tbody></tbody>
		</table>
		<br>
		<br>
		2) How about two "play sound [meow] until done" and then one "play sound [meow]"
		<br>
		<br>
		<em></em><img border="0" title="meow until done twice and meow" alt="meow until done twice and meow" src="/main-labs/img/prog/play-sound-meow-until-done-2x-then-once.jpg" >
