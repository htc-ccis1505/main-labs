	</head>
	<body>
		Create something (anything!) beautiful with the drawing tools in Scratch. For instance, we made the following image:
		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/sys/Flower.jpg" alt="Flower" title="Flower" >
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		The image above plays around with pen color and pen size. If you want to create more complex images, you probably want to use broadcasts to delegate the drawing of different parts of the image. For example, we used the following broadcasts for the image above:
		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/prog/when-i-receive-flower-messages-BYOB.gif" alt="Broadcast messages for flower" title="Broadcast messages for flower" >
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<em>Tip</em>: Your images will draw more quickly if you use <img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/sys/hide-button.png" alt="Hide" title="Hide" >to hide the sprite.
