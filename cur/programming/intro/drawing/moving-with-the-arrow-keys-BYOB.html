		Often, we will want to move the character with the arrow keys (i.e. up, down, left, and right). We can use the piece <code>point in direction</code> as shown below.
		<br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="Point in direction" alt="Point in direction" src="/main-labs/img/sys/point-in-direction-block.png" >
			<br>
		</div>
		<br>
		There are still a few things in the Scratch user interface that you probably have not used yet. Experiment with the rotation controls shown below and make sure you understand the behavior of each. These will probably come in handy at some point!
		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/sys/rotation-controls.png" alt="Rotation Controls" title="Rotation Controls" >
			<br>
		</div>
		<br>
		Finally, make a character move around based upon the keys that you have pressed. You will need to use one of the rounded "top block" pieces, such as in the example shown below. These can respond to key presses and start a script.
