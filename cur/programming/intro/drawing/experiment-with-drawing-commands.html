		Try to get comfortable with the pieces shown below. Figure out what each one does and try to use these pieces to draw a square or a simple picture.

			Note
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Once the pen is down, it stays down, even in a different script, until you say <code>pen up</code>.</li>
				<li>
					It's easiest if your sprite wears the turtle costume (the arrowhead) so you can see the direction in which it's facing very clearly.
			<br>
			</li>
				<li>
					You also will want to show the direction and x and y position of the character. In the Motion tab you can select for these to be shown on the stage (like below).
					<br>
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Try it - Does the turn command change the x or y position?
						<br>
					</li>
				</ul>
