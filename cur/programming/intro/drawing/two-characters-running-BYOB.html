		We are going to make a small game of tag in Scratch.  Make a second character that is controlled by a different set of keys.

		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/sys/renamed-sprites-BYOB.jpg" alt="Two sprites that have been renamed" title="Two sprites that have been renamed" >
			<br>
		</div>

		<br>

		We want to be able to refer to our characters with intuitive names.  By default, your sprites will probably be called things like <code>Sprite1</code> and <code>Sprite2</code>.  Rename them by clicking on the sprite and typing into the text box at the top of the screen, as shown below:

		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/sys/renaming-sprite-at-top-BYOB.jpg" alt="Cat renamed" title="Cat renamed" >
			<br>
		</div>
	</body>
