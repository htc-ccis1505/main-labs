		Try to get comfortable with the pieces shown below. Figure out what each one does and try to use these pieces to draw a square or a simple picture.

			Note

			<ul>
				<li>
					You probably want to make your character smaller so that it is easier to see where it is drawing. HINT: Check out the blocks under the "Looks" tab.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make sure that you click on the menu option in the image below so that the character displays rotations.
					<br>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You also will want to show the direction and x and y position of the character. In the Motion tab you can select for these to be shown on the stage (like below).
					<br>
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Try it - Does the turn command change the x or y position?
						<br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
