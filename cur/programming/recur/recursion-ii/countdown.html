Here we're going to discuss how we would write the following block that counts down from a number to zero.<br><img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/prog/say-numbers-block-BYOB.gif" alt="There should be an image here" title="There should be an image here" ><br><br>We discussed that we always need a base case. We can think of the base case as when the program is asked to do something SO simple, that it doesn't need to delegate at all. It knows how to do it all by itself. If x is less than 1, we've got that kind of simple case. If x is less than 1 we've decided to just say 0 and be done! <br><ul><li>NOTE: Whenever you write a recursive procedure, make sure you have a base case! Even experienced programmers will forget - so always double-check!<br></li>
