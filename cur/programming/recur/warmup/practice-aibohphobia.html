This time, we are going to use recursion to determine whether a word is a <span style="font-style: italic;">palindrome.</span><br>A palindrome is a word or number that is identical when read both forwards and backwards. Most definitions of a palindrome ignore all punctuation, so we will be doing that in our exercise today as well. Some simple palindromes include "kayak," "radar," and "dad," although sentences, poems, and stories can be palindromic as well. For a more complete list, check out <a href="http://www.palindromelist.net/">http://www.palindromelist.net/</a>.<br><h2>Exercise</h2>Create a reporter block that has a single argument (a phrase) and returns either true (if the phrase is a palindrome) or false (if the phrase is not a palindrome).  Use this block to construct another block that makes Alonzo say one of two things, depending on whether or not the phrase is a palindrome: <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="Palindromes" alt="Palindromes" src="/main-labs/img/sys/palindromes-speaking.png" ><br></div><br></body></html>
