We're going to design our search engine similarly to how Google designed theirs (a topic we'll discuss more soon). As you can probably imagine, search engines need to be able to do things <i>quickly</i> in order to be useful, but the techniques we've learned won't give us the speed we need to build a fast search engine. We're going to need something fast -- no, not just fast. <span style="font-style: italic;">L</span><i>ightning</i> fast. <br></div>

<p>Hash tables are a tremendous tool for a computer scientist's toolbox because they allow for very quick information storage and retrieval. Hash tables make use of two regular lists: one to store the index data, or <span style="font-style: italic;">keys</span>, and the other to store the data, or <span style="font-style: italic;">values</span>. Each key is paired with its own value and entered at equal points in the two lists (see red highlighted region of image). <br></p>
<p>When someone wants to know Cleopatra's phone number, it is then possible to move through the list of keys until Cleopatra's name is discovered, then look up the phone number from the list of values with the equivalent index (if Cleopatra's name is stored in slot 4 of the key list, her phone number will be stored in slot 4 of the values list). In reality, it is not necessary to move through the list in order; there is a special technique called <span style="font-style: italic;">hashing </span>(hence the name 'hash tables') that makes it possible to find elements in far less time.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> We won't go into the details of that technique here, but the combination of hashing with the two lists is what gives the hash table its power.</p>
