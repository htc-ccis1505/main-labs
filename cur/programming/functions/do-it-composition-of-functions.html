		Our custom-made blocks are blocks like any other, and we can use them in other block definitions. To demonstrate this, we are going to make a block that computes the maximum of three values.
		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			<img border="0" title="There should be an image here" alt="There should be an image here" src="/main-labs/img/prog/max-with-3-args-block-editor-BYOB.jpg" >
			<br>
		</div>
		<br>
		Repeat the steps from the last tutorial to make this version of the <code>max</code> block also  take only numbers. Then, in the script for the block, use two copies of the two-input <code>max</code> block:
		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			<img border="0" title="Script for 'max' with three arguments" alt="Script for 'max' with three arguments" src="/main-labs/img/prog/max-xyz.png" >
			<br>
		</div>
		<br><h2> Turn it In </h2> Your challenge is to make the following two blocks work:
		<ol>
			<li>
				A three-input addition operator that accepts only numbers.
				  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
					<br>
					<img border="0" title="Three-argument addition operator" alt="Three-argument addition operator" src="/main-labs/img/prog/3-arg-addition-block-BYOB.gif" >
					<br>
				</div>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				A block named "sum of two smallest" that takes three numbers as inputs, and reports the sum of the two smallest:
				  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
					<br>
					<img border="0" title="Sum of two smallest" alt="sum of two smallest block" src="/main-labs/img/prog/sum2small.png" >
				</div>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</body>
