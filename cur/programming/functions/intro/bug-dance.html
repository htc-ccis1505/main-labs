            Every good programmer goes through this at some point, and I think that you are ready.
            <br>
            <br>
            You need to make a bug dance.

            is the same thing without the big sound file).
            We've made some starter custom blocks for you, in the "Looks" palette.  Definitely <code>edit...</code>
            them to see what we've done.
            <br><br>
            And, we've included a few examples of how to put them together for a dance.  Try it out.
        </p>

        <p>
            Make at least 3 custom blocks to do complicated steps, or to repeat sets of steps in ways that
            you'll do over and over.  Add inputs to your custom blocks to change your steps in
            interesting ways.
        </p>

            We've included several costumes in the project that you should use in new steps&mdash;look
            at how we used the costumes in the custom blocks we already created. You could also import your own sounds if you would like.  Go to the <code>Sounds</code> tab above
            the scripting area and drag a sound from your computer.

            This is another program that you are welcome to share in the chatroom.  Have fun with this!
