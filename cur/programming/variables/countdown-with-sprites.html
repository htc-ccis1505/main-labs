<html><head><!-- put the following in exactly --><script src="/main-labs/llab/loader.js"></script><title>Countdown with Sprites</title></head><body> Often, we want to display text or numbers on the screen without using the <code>say</code> block. We have written a program that displays one number based upon a variable named <code>digit</code>. You can download the program <a title="Digital display" href="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab02/DigitalDisplay.sb">here</a>. You should modify this program to work for five digits! (Initially, however, you may want to start by modifying it just to work with two digits.) 
<h2>How does the original code work?</h2> We have created a <code>MyDigit</code> sprite with ten different costumes, one for each digit, as shown below. Costume 1 corresponds to the digit <code>1</code>, costume 2 corresponds to the digit <code>2</code> and so on. Costume 10 corresponds to the digit <code>0</code>. Each costume has a name (for example, <code>one</code>, as shown circled in yellow) and a number (for example, <code>1</code>, as shown circled in red). <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="Digital display" alt="Digital display" src="/main-labs/img/prog/Digit-Costumes-BYOB.jpg" ><br></div> <br> When we use the <code>switch to costume</code> block, we can specify either the name or the costume number. In the script below, we use the costume number (1-9) to set the costume unless the digit is 0. If the digit is 0, we cannot just tell it to switch to costume 0 (because there is no costume 0), so we have to use the name of the costume (<code>zero</code>).
