		<h2>Activity</h2> Try to make an electric keyboard! The code below shows a start:
		<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/prog/prog-play-note-60-62-64-65-BYOB.jpg" alt="Starting to code an Electric Keyboard" title="Starting to code an Electric Keyboard" ><h2>Hint</h2> You might want to print or draw a piano keyboard or a computer keyboard to keep track of how you have mapped keys to notes. We have provided a few images below that you can print out to work with.
		<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" style="width: 605px; height: 147px;" title="Keyboard" alt="Keyboard" src="/main-labs/img/sys/Keyboard.jpg" >
		<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" style="width: 637px; height: 246px;" title="Computer Keyboard" alt="Computer Keyboard" src="/main-labs/img/sys/CompKeyboard.jpg" ><h2>Challenge</h2> Try to set up sprites for each key on the keyboard. When the letter that is mapped to the key is pressed you can darken the key by changing its costume to simulate it being pressed.
		<br>
		<br>
		Add additional functionality, perhaps by adding scripts for other keys on the computer keyboard, so that your electric keyboard can change:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Volume,
			</li>
			<li>
				Instrument, and/or
			</li>
			<li>
				Tempo.
			</li>
		</ul>
