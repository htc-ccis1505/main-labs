In today's lab, we are going to get more practice working with lists by making a representation of a game board.  Make a new block as shown below that takes in a list and an <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> value.  It should make a new board with a <code>B</code> for every spot (representing a blank).

For example, the board below was made with <code>x</code> set to <code>4</code> (the number of columns) and <code>y</code> set to <code>6</code> (the number of rows).

<em>Note</em>: We chose to have the block modify the existing list <code>game board</code>, instead of reporting a <em>new</em> list, as shown in the example in the image below.  Think about how you could make a reporter block like the one below.  Remember that there is no <code>set</code> block for lists!
