</ul>Before you make the block below "Set" that takes in an x and y value, a list and a new character, try to write the block "copy letters" that you can use in the set function. Copy letters should report the letters from a minimum index to a maximum index and should include the letters at both the minimum and maximum index.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/prog/copy-letters-result-BYOB.jpg" alt="There should be an image here" title="There should be an image here" ><br></div><br>The next page has a hint about copy letters.
