Don't forget to use the "list-&gt;sentence" block, and <i>make sure you use a list</i> in the script that defines this block. Note that transform-beatles does <i>not</i> take a list or a sentence as an input.<br><br> We can use this to "amazify" the Beatles!

<div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="The amazify block" alt="There should be an image here" src="/main-labs/img/hof/amazify-block.png" ></div>
<p>Hint: First write a version of transform-beatles that reports a <i>list of length four</i> in which each element is one transformed Beatle, then modify the definition to turn the list into sentence form.</p>
<h3>Try another problem<br></h3>
<p>Now use your transform-beatles block with an input that will cause it to report the sentence "J P G R" -- the initials of the Beatles. </p>   </body></html>
