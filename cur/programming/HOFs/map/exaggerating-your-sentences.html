Sometimes you might like to exaggerate your statements to make a point.  Make an "exaggerate" block which exaggerates sentences. It will double every number that is in the input:
<p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/hof/exaggerate-block-call2.png" title="There should be an image here" ></div>

<p>Your block should also change "good" to "great," "bad" to "terrible," and so on.
</p><p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="/main-labs/img/hof/exaggerate-block-call.png" title="There should be an image here" ></div>
<p>

Hint: First make an exaggerate-word block that takes a single <i>word</i> (or number) as input, and reports the exaggerated version of that word.  (If it isn't a number or one of the special words like "good," then it doesn't change.)   </p></body></html>
