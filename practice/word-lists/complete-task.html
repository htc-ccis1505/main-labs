	</head>
	<body>
		<h2>Code so far...</h2>
		<p>
				Your collect items block should look similar to what you see below:
		</p>
		<img src="/main-labs/practice/images/todo/collect-items.png" alt="Command block to collect tasks." /><br/>

		<h2>Check for Completed Tasks</h2>
		<p>
			Before we remove a task from the list, we need to check to see if the task has been completed.  We'll hide the details of checking inside of a predicate block.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>Try It!</strong>
			<br>Make a predicate block that takes a task as input and ask if that task is completed.
			<br> - Prompt the user to enter Yes or No, but also allow them to enter Y or N.
			<br> - Make sure to validate the response and ask until a valid answer was entered.
			<br> - If Yes/Y was entered report <code>true</code> and if No/N then report <code>false</code>.
