		<h2>Code so far...</h2>
		<p>
				At this point, you should have a global variable for your to do list, and your main script should look similar to what you see below:

		<h2>Collect Tasks</h2>
		<p>
			Now we're ready to write code to get the tasks.  Edit your custom block and let's add some code!
		</p>

		<p>
			We need a way to know when the user is done entering tasks.  Let's have them enter a Q (for quit) when they are done.  When they enter a Q, then we can set a variable to indicate that we can stop looping.  This will let us use a <code>repeat until</code> loop to collect all of the tasks.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>Try it!</strong>
			<br>Make a script variable to indicate we are done and all tasks have been entered.  Set up a <code>repeat until</code> loop that will loop until that variable is true.
		</p>

		<p>
		 Inside the loop, we can now ask the user to enter a task or Q to quit.  If they enter a Q, then set the variable to indicate we are done.  Otherwise, if that task is text (there is an Operator block to check this), then add it to the to do list.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>Try it!</strong>
			<br>Finish coding the block and test it. You should be able to add items to the to do list until you enter a Q.  Make sure that if you enter nothing or something that is not text, that it is not added to the list.
