		<h2>Conditional Program Flow</h2>
		<p>
			One way to conditionally alter flow is by using the <code>if</code> or <code>if-else</code> blocks.  We can also have a loop repeat conditionally.  The <code>repeat until</code> block allows us to loop until a condition is true.  We repeat the loop while the condition is <code>false</code>, and stop when it becomes <code>true</code>.
		</p>

		<h3>Example</h3>
		<p>
      Often when we ask for user input we want to do some verification that what they enter is what we expect, and if it isn't we'll ask again.  Let's ask the answer to a simple question: What is 2 + 2?  Then we will make sure that the person enters a number by repeating the ask until a number is entered.

			Make sure that you understand the program flow. Click to run the script and follow along as the script is run, pointing to each block the code runs. Answer with a letter, answer with a word, then answer with a number.
