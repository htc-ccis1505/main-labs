		<h2>Variables for Constants?</h2>
		<p>
				While it may not sound like it makes a lot of sense, we often use variables for values that we don't expect to change while the program is running.  These variables are called <strong>constants</strong> and they are often given names in all capital letters. Our max and min speed make great constants.

		<p>
			If you didn't make variables for the min and max, update your script to do so.
