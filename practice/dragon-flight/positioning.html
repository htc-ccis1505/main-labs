		<h2>Code so far...</h2>
		<p>
				At this point, your script should look similar to what you see below.

		<h2>Let there be flight!</h2>
		<p>
				We're going to fly our dragon around the stage, but we need to make sure that he stays on the stage and doesn't fly away where we can't see him.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
			Recall from <a href="/main-labs/cur-new/programming/snap-intro/positions-onthe-stage.html">Lab 1: Position on the Stage</a> that the stage has min and max coordinates of -180 and -180, and max and min y coordinates of -240 and 240.
		</p>

		<p>
			We can use a forever loop with a <code>move []</code> block to fly the dragon around, but he will soon fly off the stage.
		</p>
		<img src="/main-labs/practice/images/dragon-flight/uncontrolled-flight.png" alt="Move forever script with no bounds." /><br/>
		<p>
			To prevent that, we can alter the direction the dragon sprite will move in using the <code>point in direction []</code> block.  By changing the direction by a value between 90 and 180 we can get the dragon moving back on the stage. By using a random value, we'll make the flight more interesting.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>Try it!</strong>
			<br>Use blocks to <em>conditionally</em> change the direction of the dragon when he starts to wander too close to the edge.
			<br>Too close to the edge is about:
			<br> - a min x position of -180 or a max x position of 180
			<br> - a min y position of -135 and a max y position of 140
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
			If your dragon seems to stick on the edges, adding a <code>change x by: []</code> or a <code>change y by: []</code> to bump him in the opposite direction may help.
