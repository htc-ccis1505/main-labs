		<h2>Conditional Program Flow</h2>
		<p>
			Generally speaking, programs run sequentially top to bottom, but some blocks can alter that flow before allowing the script to continue on to the next block. We've seen how a repeat block can alter that sequential flow. Using a custom block also alters that flow, by causing the steps inside that block to run before the main script goes on to the next block.
		</p>

    <p>
        Another way to alter the flow is with conditional logic.  For this exercise we will look more closely at <code>if</code> and <code> if-else</code> blocks.
		</p>
		<p>
				First let's look at the <code>if</code> block.  This will cause something to happen when some condition (a boolean expression) is <em>true</em>.  If that condition is not true, then nothing happens. The program just continues with the next block in the sequence.
		</p>

		<h3>Simple if</h3>
		<p>Let's make a short script to ask someone to answer a simple question - like what is 2 + 2.  We will then verify that they entered a number.  If it is not a number, we'll tell them "Sorry, that isn't a number."</p>

		<p>
			On the Operators palette you'll find many blocks for doing math, working with booleans, and the <code>Is [] a [number]</code> used above. That block will return true if the value is a number, and false otherwise.  Since that is the opposite of the behavior we want, we place that block inside of a <code>not</code> block.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
			Remember that in programming, yes and no is represented by the boolean values for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.
		</p>

    <p>
      Run the script by clicking on it, and watch the program flow.  Enter a number when asked.  Does the code do what you expect?  It skips the say block inside of the <code>if</code> block and the script ends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Run the script again, and this time enter a letter instead of a number. Watch the program flow. Does the code do what you expect?  This time the <code>say</code> block inside of the <code>if</code> block is run before the script ends.
    </p>

		<h3>Repeat until</h3>
		<p>
      Let's make sure that the person enters a number by repeating the ask until a number is entered.  To do this, we will change the <code>if</code> to a <cod>repeat until</code> block. The repeat until will repeat the steps inside the C-shape part of the block <em>until</em> the condition is true.  Since we want this to repeat until answer is a number, we remove the not.
    </p>
		<img src="/main-labs/practice/images/dragon-flight/repeat-until.png" alt="Image of ask with repeat until answer is a number" /><br/>

		<p>
			Click it to run the script again. Follow along again as the script is run, pointing to each block the code runs. Answer with a letter, answer with a word, then answer with a number. Can you predict what will happen next based on what you answer?
		</p>

		<h3>Simple if-else</h3>
		<p>
			The last conditional block we'll look at here is the <code>if-else</code> block.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
			Remember that an <code>if-else</code> block is different than an <code>if</code> block because with the <code>if</code> block either something will happen or nothing at all.  With the <code>if-else</code> block, one of two options will always happen - either the <strong>if</strong> part or the <strong>else</strong> part.
		</p>

    <p>
      Update the code to use an <code>if-else</code> block. We will use this to give a message to say whether or not the answer was correct.
    </p>
		<img src="/main-labs/practice/images/dragon-flight/simple-ifelse.png" alt="Image with the if else check for the answer is 4" /><br/>
		<p>
			Run the code again, and follow through the code. Run it and eneter 4 - the correct answer, and then run it again entering a different number. Notice that unlike the <code>if</code> block and the <code>repeat until</code> where the code inside may not run, some part of the <code>if-else</code> block is always run.
