		<h2>Variables</h2>
		<p>
			Recall that a variable allows you to name and store and change a value.  Variables have what is called a <strong><em>scope</em></strong>, which indicates where the variable is visible and can be used.  The scope of a script variable is the script that it is defined in.  The scope of an input parameter is the block (or function) that it is part of.

		<h3>Global Variables</h3>
    <p class="alert quoteOrange">
      In <a href="/main-labs/cur/programming/variables/global-variables.html">Lab 4: Script Variables</a>, we learned how to make and use a global variable.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you create a global variable, you can choose to make it available to your entire program (all sprites) or limit it to just the current sprite.  This is defining the scope of the global variable.  For this class, keep the default of all sprites.  Global variables defined in this way can be used in all scripts, including within custom blocks (functions) without passing in the value as input.
		</p>

		<p>The following all work just fine; no scope problems or errors.</p>

		<p>
			The variable blocks to set, change, show, and hide variables work for both script variables and global variables.  There is also an option to show and hide global variables by using the checkbox next to the variable on the Variables palette.
