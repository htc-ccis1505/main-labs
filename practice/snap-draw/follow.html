				We'll start by clearing the screen and making the sprite follow the mouse while the program is running.  We saw code to do this in the first lab.
		</p>

		<h2>Main Script</h2>
		<p>
			The main script (for a sprite) is the one that starts when the Green Flag icon is clicked.  You should have only one of these scripts for each sprite.  This is strictly for organization and to make it easier to understand your code; it won't cause an error.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
		  There is no error if you have more than one, however one may run faster or slower than the other, so the output from your program might vary each time it is run.
		</p>

		<p>
			Add the hat block to start your script when the green flag is clicked.  Then find the <code>clear</code> block on the Pen palette and add that to clear the stage when the program starts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Next, we want the sprite to continue to follow the mouse cursor while the program is running.  Do you remember how to do this?  We looked at this in Lab 1: <a href="/main-labs/cur-new/programming/loops/forever/follow-that-mouse.html">Follow That Mouse</a>.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			Try to get this part of the script working without peeking at the answer on the next page.  When you click the Green Flag, the sprite should follow your mouse around the stage area. It should continue to follow the mouse until you click the Red Stop icon.
