				We're going to build a simple drawing program.  We'll use the up and down arrow keys to control when the pen is up or down and will use other keys to change the pen color.

			<p>We will use the following blocks for this practice:</p>

		</div>

		<h2>Program Flow</h2>
		<p>
			To understand how to put the pieces together, it is important to remember that the <code>When</code> hat-shaped blocks from the Control palette, control when a script will start running.  When that script is started, then it will run each block in order, sequentially, from top to bottom.
		</p>

    <p>
        Loops can be used to repeat steps in that sequential flow.  Think about the instructions for shampooing your hair:
				<br> - Wet hair
				<br> - Apply shampoo
				<br> - Massage into hair to lather
				<br> - Rinse and repeat
		</p>
		<p>
				This "repeat" means to go back up to the top of the steps and do it again from the beginning.   Let's program this in <span class="snap">snap</span>.
