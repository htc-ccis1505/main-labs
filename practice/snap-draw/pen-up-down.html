		<h2>Script so far...</h2>
		<p>
				At this point, your script should look like what you see below.
		</p>
		<img src="/main-labs/practice/images/snap-draw/main-follow.png" alt="Image of main script to clear and follow mouse" /><br/>

		<p>
			When you click the Green Flag, the sprite should follow your mouse around the stage area. It should continue to follow the mouse until you click the Red Stop icon.
		</p>

		<h2>Pen Up and Down</h2>
		<p>
			The next step is to have the pen go up and down when the arrow keys are pressed. For this, we need more scripts, each starting with their own hat-shaped block.  Locate the <code>When [space] key pressed</code> block on the Control palette. Notice that you can change which key it responds to by using the drop down next to [space].
		</p>

		<p>
			Add one <code>When [space] key pressed</code> block to respond to the up arrow key.  Add the <code>Pen up</code> block to this script.  That block is found on the Pen palette.
		</p>

		<p>
			Add another <code>When [space] key pressed</code> block to respond to the down arrow key.  Add the <code>Pen down</code> block to this script.  That block is also found on the Pen palette.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			Try to get this part of the script working without peeking at the answer on the next page.  When you are done, you should be able to click the green flag to have the sprite follow the mouse around the stage area. When you push the down arrow and then move the mouse, it should draw.  When you push the up arrow it should stop drawing.
