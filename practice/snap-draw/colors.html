		<h2>Script so far...</h2>
		<p>
				At this point, your script should look like what you see below.
		</p>
		<img src="/main-labs/practice/images/snap-draw/pen-up-down.png" alt="Image of main script, and pen up / down scripts" /><br/>

		<p>
			When you click the Green Flag, the sprite should follow your mouse around the stage area. When you push the down arrow and then move the mouse, it should draw.  When you push the up arrow it should stop drawing.
		</p>

		<h2>Add Colors</h2>
		<p>
			The next step is to have change the pen color when different keys are pressed.  Find the <code>set pen color to []</code> block on the Pen palette.  We will use this to change the color when different keys are pressed.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
			There is a color picker on the <code>set pen color to []</code> block which you can access by clicking on the colored square.
		</p>

		<p>
			Make scripts using the <code>When [space] key pressed</code> and <code>set pen color to []</code> block to do the following:
			<br> - when the R key is pressed, set it to a red color
			<br> - when the G key is pressed, set it to a green color
			<br> - when the B key is pressed, set it to a blue color
			<br> - when the Y key is pressed, set it to a yellow color
			<br> - when the P key is pressed, set it to a purple color
			<br> - when the O key is pressed, set it to an orange color
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			Try it out.  When you press the letter keys, you should be able to draw in different colors!  Remember to put your pen down first.
