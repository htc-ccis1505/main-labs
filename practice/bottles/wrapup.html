		<h2>Final Code?</h2>
		<p>
				At this point, your script should look similar to what you see below.

			<strong>Challenge:</strong>
			<br>Can you rewrite the code a different way?  Perhaps try using a different type of loop or making fewer or additional variables, or add or remove custom blocks.
			<br>
			<br>Compare your new code to the old and consider pros and cons of each approach. Do you think one is better or worse?  Is one easier to read or understand than the other?  Longer or shorter?  Simpler or more complex?
