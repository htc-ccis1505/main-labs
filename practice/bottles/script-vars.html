		<h2>Variables</h2>
		<p>
			A variable is a placeholder in your code.  It is a place to store a value so that you can come back to it or use it multiple times.  As you might expect from the name, it is <em>variable</em> meaning that its value can change.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are two different types of variables in <span class="snap">Snap</span>: script variables and global variables. For this exercise we will focus on script variables.
		</p>


		<h3>Script Variables</h3>
    <p class="alert quoteOrange">
      In <a href="/main-labs/cur-new/programming/variables/scriptvar.html">Lab 3: Script Variables</a>, we learned how to make and use a script variable.
		</p>

		<p>
			A script variable is only usable in the script where it is made.  It cannot be used in another script, even within the same sprite.

		<p>
			To use a script variable inside a custom block, you must pass it in as input to that block.

		<h3>Set and Change</h3>
		<p>
			To set a variable, you use the set block.  This gives the variable a specific value.  The change block alters (adds or subtracts from) the existing value by the amount entered.  The show and hide blocks allow you to see the variable's value and can be helpful for debugging your script.
