		<h2>The Song</h2>
		<p>
			We want the sprite to sing the lyrics to 99 Bottles, which is a song that repeats the same words with one less bottle on the wall each verse, until there are no more.  Traditionally the song is about beer, but we're going to use a variable for what's in the bottle so you can make it whatever you like.  It goes like this:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			99 bottles of beer on the wall
			<br>99 bottles of beer
			<br>Take one down, pass it around
			<br>98 bottles of beer on the wall
			<br>
			<br>98 bottles of beer on the wall
			<br>98 bottles of beer
			<br>Take one down, pass it around
			<br>97 bottles of beer on the wall
			<br>
			<br>... and so on ..
			<br>
			<br>2 bottles of beer on the wall
			<br>2 bottles of beer
			<br>Take one down, pass it around
			<br>1 bottle of beer on the wall
			<br>
			<br>1 bottle of beer on the wall
			<br>1 bottle of beer
			<br>Take one down, pass it around
			<br>No more bottles of beer on the wall
		</blockquote>

			It's important to note that the last verses are a little different for two reasons:
			<br> - We say 1 bottle, not 1 bottles - singular not plural. That affects the last two verses.
			<br> - The last verse says there are "no more bottles", not 0 bottles.
		</p>

		<h3>Code the Verse</h3>
		<p>
			Let's start by writing code just to say the main verse. Be sure to create and use two script variables:
			<br> - one for the number of bottles
			<br> - and for what is in the bottles
		</p>

		<p>
			For now, don't worry about the differences in last two verses.  We'll deal with that part next.  For now just get the say and join blocks together and then put them inside of a loop.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>Try it:</strong>
			<br>Try to get that sprite singing! The says's are sequential, but to repeat them we need a loop.  What kind of loop do you think will work best?
