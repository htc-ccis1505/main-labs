				At this point, your script should be singing the song, <b>but</b> there are some bugs in the last two verses. Let's work on fixing those next.

		<h2>Fix the Last Line</h2>
		<p>
			We still need to fix the last two verses.  There are a few ways to do this, but we're going to aim for repeating as little code as possible.  To do this, we'll modify the code to conditionally say the correct last line, altering it for the last verse.
		</p>

		<p class="alert quoteGreen">
			<strong>Try it:</strong>
			<br> - There are two possibilities for what to say, so what block will help us to <em>conditionally</em> say the right thing?
			<br> - What condition do we need to use in that block?  Think about that in terms of what is <code>true</code> when we say "# bottle(s) of beer on the wall", and what is <code>false</code> when we say "No more bottles of beer on the wall".
